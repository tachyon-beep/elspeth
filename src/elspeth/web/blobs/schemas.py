    block across (ready, pending, error) is statically checkable, and

    rather than by the client's runtime handling.

    translate malformed input into HTTP errors.

    - ``filename`` is run through :func:`sanitize_filename`, which rejects
      empty/``.``/``..`` names and strips path-traversal components.  A
      failure surfaces as a 422 via FastAPI's ``RequestValidationError``.
    - ``mime_type`` is a closed ``Literal`` over the allowed set so the
      caller cannot declare an unsupported type.  Default remains
      ``text/plain`` to preserve the previous ergonomic default.
    - ``extra="forbid"`` rejects unknown keys.  Previously a caller who
      sent ``content_type`` (the old field name) or ``mime-type`` got a
      silent fallback to the default MIME — now they get a 422.
