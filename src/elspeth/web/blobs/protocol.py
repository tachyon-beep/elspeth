# ─── Blob exception family ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Pattern parity with ``elspeth.web.composer.protocol.ComposerServiceError``
# and siblings: every declared attribute is frozen after construction
# via ``_FROZEN_ATTRS`` + ``__setattr__`` override, matching the
# commit-landed contract in the composer family (see composer/protocol.py
# for the full rationale block).  Why apply it here: these exception
# instances flow into HTTP response bodies (404/409/413/500) and into
# structured audit/telemetry emission sites; allowing post-construction
# reassignment would let any intermediate layer silently rewrite what
# downstream consumers see.
#
# Divergence from composer family — NO ``capture()`` classmethod:
# the composer classes use ``capture()`` to encapsulate a derivation
# rule (``partial_state = state if state.version > initial_version
# else None``) as a single source of truth across raise sites.  Blob
# exceptions have no such rule — every attribute is an input from the
# raise site, not derived from surrounding scope.  Adding a pro-forma
# ``capture()`` here would be ceremony without purpose.  If a future
# blob exception grows a real derivation rule, introduce ``capture()``
# at that point so the rule has one home.
#
# Identity args (``blob_id``, ``session_id``) are positional; secondary
# payload args (``run_id``, byte counts, hashes, message text) are
# keyword-only.  This matches the composer pattern's split and makes
# raise sites self-documenting — operators scanning ``raise
# BlobActiveRunError(blob_id, run_id=run)`` immediately see which
# identifier is the subject and which is the context.
