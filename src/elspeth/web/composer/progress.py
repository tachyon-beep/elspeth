    Three sub-causes (composition turn budget, discovery turn budget, wall-clock
    timeout) used to collapse into one generic ``phase: failed`` event because
    only ``ComposerConvergenceError.budget_exhausted`` carried the discriminator
    and the emit sites discarded it. This helper is the single dispatch point
    — both the service-level catch (compose() outer try/except) and the
    route-handler catches in web/sessions/routes.py route through it so the
    per-cause headline / evidence / likely_next / reason copy is defined
    exactly once.

    Lives in this module rather than service.py because:

    - the failure-mode taxonomy is a property of the progress contract, not
      the service implementation;
    - taking a string discriminator (not the exception) avoids importing
      ``ComposerConvergenceError`` from ``composer.protocol``, which already
      imports ``ComposerProgressSink`` from this module — keeping the helper
      here would otherwise create a circular import.

    Recovery copy is what the user can act on:

    - composition budget → split the request into smaller turns
    - discovery budget   → narrow the schema/catalog exploration
    - wall-clock timeout → retry, or ask an operator to raise the server budget
