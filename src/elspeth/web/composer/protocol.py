    Signals a Tier-3 boundary failure: the LLM provided arguments of the
    wrong type, or semantically invalid values that the handler cannot
    coerce. The compose loop catches this exception and returns the
    message to the LLM as a tool error so it can retry.

    This is the ONLY exception class the compose loop catches around
    execute_tool(). Any other TypeError/ValueError/UnicodeError/KeyError
    escaping a tool handler is a plugin bug and MUST crash — per
    CLAUDE.md, plugin bugs that silently produce wrong results are worse
    than a crash because they pollute the audit trail with confidently
    wrong data.

    Inheritance rationale: this class inherits from ``Exception`` directly,
    NOT from ``ComposerServiceError``. A handler-internal signal caught by
    the compose loop must not be absorbed by the route-level generic
    ``except ComposerServiceError`` block (present in both the compose and
    recompose endpoints of ``web/sessions/routes.py``), which would
    silently convert an escaped ToolArgumentError into a 502 — recreating
    the laundering pattern the compose-loop narrowing is designed to
    eliminate. If a ToolArgumentError ever escapes ``_compose_loop``, that
    is a compose-loop bug: FastAPI's default handler will surface it as
    an unstructured 500 for investigation, which is the correct failure
    mode for an invariant violation.

    Structural safety (leak prevention)
    -----------------------------------
    The message composed by this class is echoed verbatim to the LLM
    API by the compose loop AND recorded in the Landscape audit trail
    via the synthetic ``role: tool`` chat message. Free-form f-string
    construction — ``ToolArgumentError(f"bad value: {user_input!r}")``
    — would be a direct leak channel for secrets, PII, and
    attacker-controlled strings, because Tier-3 argument values are
    by definition untrusted.

    To make that leak structurally impossible, this class accepts ONLY
    three keyword-only, safe-by-construction fields:

    - ``argument``: the parameter name as declared in the tool schema
      (operator-chosen — safe for echo/audit).
    - ``expected``: a brief description of the required shape, e.g.
      ``"a string"`` or ``"a non-empty list"`` (operator-chosen — safe).
    - ``actual_type``: typically ``type(value).__name__`` — carries
      only the class name, never the value.

    There is deliberately no field that can carry the LLM-supplied
    value. The ``__cause__`` chain still carries full debugging
    context for auditors (inspectable via ``exc.__cause__`` on the
    captured exception record) but is NEVER echoed to the LLM: the
    compose loop reads ``exc.args[0]`` only, and ``args[0]`` is
    composed from the structured fields above.

    The three declared fields are frozen after construction, matching
    the pattern used by ``ComposerConvergenceError`` and
    ``ComposerPluginCrashError``: each exception flows into an
    immutable audit artefact, so allowing post-construction mutation
    would let an intermediate layer silently rewrite what downstream
    consumers see. Exception-chain dunders
    (``__cause__``/``__context__``/``__traceback__``/``__notes__``)
    remain writable so ``raise ... from ...`` and ``add_note()`` work
    normally.

    Usage::

        raise ToolArgumentError(
            argument="content",
            expected="a string",
            actual_type=type(content).__name__,
        ) from exc

    The ``from exc`` clause preserves the underlying cause on
    ``__cause__`` so it survives ``asyncio.to_thread`` re-raise for
    audit, without leaking into the LLM echo.
