"""Generic semantic-contract validator.

For each consumer node with declared input_semantic_requirements(),
walks back to the effective upstream producer (using ProducerResolver),
asks the producer for its output_semantics(), and compares facts to
requirements per field. Emits structured SemanticEdgeContract records
and high-severity ValidationEntry errors on CONFLICT or on UNKNOWN +
FAIL policy.

This module reuses ProducerResolver — there must be exactly ONE
walk-back implementation across composer state.

Pass-through propagation is intentionally NOT performed in Phase 1.
A pass-through transform between a declared producer and a declared
consumer breaks the chain — the consumer sees outcome=UNKNOWN, which
combined with line_explode's FAIL policy means the chain rejects.
This is by design: it forces a real propagation API decision rather
than making an ad hoc choice.
