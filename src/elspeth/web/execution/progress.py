"""ProgressBroadcaster — thread-safe bridge from sync pipeline to async WebSocket.

B1 Fix: All cross-thread pushes use loop.call_soon_threadsafe() to schedule
work on the event loop thread. Direct queue.put_nowait() from a background
thread would corrupt the event loop's internal state.

Backpressure (coalesced-drain): broadcast() does NOT schedule one callback
per event. Each event is appended to a per-subscriber bounded ``pending``
deque under ``self._lock``; a single ``_drain_pending`` callback is
scheduled only when the subscriber's ``drain_scheduled`` flag flips
False → True. That callback runs on the event loop thread, drains the
pending deque to the subscriber's ``asyncio.Queue``, and re-schedules
itself via ``loop.call_soon`` while pending is non-empty (to yield to
other loop work between batches). This bounds the number of pending
``Handle`` objects in the loop's internal ``_ready`` deque to one per
subscriber, rather than one per (event x subscriber) — the earlier
design let the loop's callback queue grow unboundedly even though the
async queue stayed at its maxsize, defeating the OOM guard under slow
WebSocket clients.

Construction timing: Created inside the FastAPI lifespan async context manager,
NOT in the synchronous create_app() factory. The loop reference is captured via
asyncio.get_running_loop() inside the lifespan, which guarantees a running event
loop exists and is Python 3.12+ compatible (asyncio.get_event_loop() emits a
deprecation warning when no running loop exists). The ExecutionServiceImpl is
also constructed inside the lifespan (after ProgressBroadcaster), not in
create_app(), because it depends on the broadcaster instance.
