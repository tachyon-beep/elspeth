"""ExecutionServiceImpl — background pipeline execution with thread safety.

Thread safety fixes implemented here:
- B2: Always pass shutdown_event=threading.Event() to Orchestrator.run()
- B3: Construct LandscapeDB/PayloadStore from WebSettings resolvers
- B7: except BaseException + future.add_done_callback() safety net
- B8/C1: _call_async() bridges sync thread to async event loop for SessionService

The _run_pipeline() method is the ONLY code that runs outside the asyncio
event loop. Everything else runs in the main async context. Because
SessionService methods are async, _run_pipeline() uses _call_async() to
schedule coroutines on the main event loop from the background thread.
