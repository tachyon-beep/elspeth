"""Plugin protocols — structural contracts for Source, Transform, Sink plugins.

These protocols define what methods plugins must implement.
They're primarily used for type checking (that's pluggy's job for runtime
enforcement), with one exception: TransformProtocol is @runtime_checkable
because the engine uses isinstance() to discriminate transforms from gates
and coalesce nodes during DAG traversal.

Plugin Types:
- Source: Loads data into the system (one per run)
- Transform: Processes rows (stateless)
- Sink: Outputs data (one or more per run)
