# src/elspeth/contracts/config/protocols.py
"""Runtime protocols for Settings -> Runtime enforcement.

These protocols define what engine components EXPECT from runtime config.
By having runtime config classes implement these protocols, we get:
1. Compile-time verification that Settings fields reach runtime
2. Clear documentation of what each component needs

Protocol Pattern:
    - Protocol defines minimal interface a component needs
    - Runtime config dataclass implements the protocol
    - Component accepts the protocol, not the concrete class
    - mypy verifies structural compatibility

Example:
    class RuntimeRetryConfig:
        max_attempts: int
        base_delay: float
        ...

    def __init__(self, config: RuntimeRetryProtocol):
        # mypy verifies RuntimeRetryConfig satisfies this
        self._config = config

Note on jitter:
    jitter is INTERNAL to RuntimeRetryConfig (hardcoded to 1.0, not in Settings).
    It's included in RuntimeRetryProtocol because RetryManager needs to access it
    for tenacity's wait_exponential_jitter(). However, it's not a Settings field -
    the value is always provided by RuntimeRetryConfig's factory methods.
