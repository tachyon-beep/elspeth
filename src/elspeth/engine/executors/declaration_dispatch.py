"""Declaration-contract runtime dispatcher (ADR-010 §Decision 3 + §Semantics).

Adopts **audit-complete with aggregation** posture per comment #417 on
`elspeth-425047a599` (ADR-010 §Semantics amendment, 2026-04-20). On a (row,
call-site) tuple that would violate multiple registered contracts, the
dispatcher DOES NOT short-circuit on the first violation — it collects every
contract's raised audit-evidence exception, attaches dispatcher attribution
to each DCV child, and at loop end:

    * 0 violations → return normally.
    * 1 violation  → raise ``violations[0]`` via reference equality
                     (N6 regression invariant at N=1 — the raise MUST be
                     identity-preserving, NOT an aggregation-of-one wrapper).
    * >=2          → wrap in ``AggregateDeclarationContractViolation`` and
                     raise.

Rationale (see ADR-010 §Semantics amendment):

> ELSPETH's CLAUDE.md "Auditability Standard" makes "I don't know what
> happened" structurally impermissible for any output. Under fail-fast
> first-fire semantics, the audit trail's silence on a second contract's
> evaluation is indistinguishable from "checked and passed" — a Repudiation
> surface (STRIDE) the auditor cannot resolve. Under audit-complete, every
> applicable contract's method runs; every violation is recorded; absence
> in the audit trail means "checked and passed," not "skipped because an
> earlier contract fired."

Four public dispatch sites (H2 §Fix direction):

    * ``run_pre_emission_checks(inputs)`` — before transform.process().
    * ``run_post_emission_checks(inputs, outputs)`` — after process().
    * ``run_batch_flush_checks(inputs, outputs)`` — batch-flush TRANSFORM mode.
    * ``run_boundary_checks(inputs, outputs)`` — source / sink boundary (2C).

A single shared helper (``_dispatch``) implements the collect-then-raise
pattern once; each public function is a thin site-tagged wrapper. This
satisfies F2 §Acceptance "single shared helper with the post-emission
dispatcher, not parallel implementation" — the four sites share ONE
orchestration body.

Catch scope (see ``_dispatch``):

    * ``DeclarationContractViolation`` — primary audit-evidence base.
    * ``PluginContractViolation`` — ``PassThroughContractViolation`` inherits
      this and predates the ADR-010 DCV hierarchy. Catching it here is
      required for audit-complete — otherwise pass-through's raise would
      short-circuit the loop and shadow every later contract on the same
      row. ``PluginContractViolation`` does not support
      ``_attach_contract_name`` (no C4 one-shot flag); the authoritative
      contract name is carried in its 9-key ``to_audit_dict()`` payload
      (``transform`` + ``transform_node_id``) for the single specific
      exception class.

Non-audit-evidence exceptions (plugin bugs raising arbitrary exceptions
from ``applies_to`` or the dispatch method) propagate UNMODIFIED per the
CLAUDE.md plugin-ownership posture — a buggy contract is a framework bug
that must crash.
