"""NodeStateGuard — structural guarantee that node states reach terminal status.

The invariant "every token reaches exactly one terminal state" is central to
ELSPETH's audit integrity.  Before this guard, the invariant was enforced by
manually-scoped try/except blocks in each executor.  The problem: post-processing
code (output hashing, contract evolution) lived OUTSIDE those blocks, so failures
there left node_states permanently OPEN — violating the audit trail.

NodeStateGuard encodes the invariant structurally: any unhandled exception within
the ``with`` block automatically completes the state as FAILED before propagating.

class NodeStateGuard:
    """Context manager that guarantees a node state reaches terminal status.

    Opens a node state in ``__enter__`` and, if the caller has not explicitly
    completed it before an exception triggers ``__exit__``, auto-completes the
    state as FAILED with the exception details.

    Usage::

        with NodeStateGuard(recorder, token_id=..., node_id=..., ...) as guard:
            ctx.state_id = guard.state_id
            # ... processing ...

    If an exception is raised before ``guard.complete()`` is called, the state
    is automatically completed as FAILED.  If ``guard.complete()`` was already
    called, ``__exit__`` is a no-op (the state is already terminal).
