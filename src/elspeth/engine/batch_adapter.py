# src/elspeth/engine/batch_adapter.py
"""Adapter for batch transform integration with TransformExecutor.

Allows TransformExecutor to call accept() and wait for results while
maintaining concurrency across multiple rows.

Architecture:
    Orchestrator → TransformExecutor → [BatchTransformMixin] → Worker Pool

                                    SharedBatchAdapter (this file)
                                             ↓
                                    Multiple RowWaiters registered by (token_id, state_id)
                                             ↓
                                    emit() routes results to correct waiter
                                             ↓
                                    Each waiter.wait() returns its result

The key insight is that ONE adapter is connected to the transform's output port,
but MULTIPLE waiters can be registered (one per in-flight row). The emit() method
routes each result to the correct waiter based on (token_id, state_id).

Retry Safety:
    Waiters are keyed by (token_id, state_id) to prevent stale results from being
    delivered to retry attempts. If a timeout occurs and a retry happens, the new
    attempt gets a new state_id, so the old worker's result goes to the orphaned
    waiter (which will be garbage collected), not to the retry's waiter.

Exception Propagation:
    Plugin bugs should crash the orchestrator (CLAUDE.md compliance). Worker threads
    wrap uncaught exceptions in ExceptionResult so they propagate through the async
    pattern. RowWaiter.wait() detects these and re-raises the original exception.

class SharedBatchAdapter:
    """Shared output port adapter for batch transforms.

    Allows multiple rows to be in flight concurrently while routing
    results back to the correct waiter based on (token_id, state_id).

    This solves the deadlock in the previous BlockingResultAdapter design,
    where one adapter per row was created but only the first was connected
    to the transform's output port.

    Retry Safety:
        Waiters are keyed by (token_id, state_id) to prevent stale results
        from being delivered to retry attempts. Each attempt gets a unique
        state_id from begin_node_state(), so:
        - First attempt: state_id=abc → waiter keyed by (token, abc)
        - Timeout → waiter times out
        - Retry: state_id=def → NEW waiter keyed by (token, def)
        - First worker finishes → emit with state_id=abc → no matching waiter
        - Retry worker finishes → emit with state_id=def → correct waiter

    Thread Safety:
        - register() called by orchestrator thread (sequential)
        - emit() called by BatchTransformMixin's release thread
        - wait() called by orchestrator thread (blocks until result)
        - All shared state protected by self._lock

    Usage:
        adapter = SharedBatchAdapter()
        transform.connect_output(adapter, max_pending=30)

        # For each row (sequential in orchestrator):
        waiter = adapter.register(token.token_id, ctx.state_id)
