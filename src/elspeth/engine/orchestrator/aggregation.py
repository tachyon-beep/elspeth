"""Aggregation handling functions for the orchestrator.

This module contains functions for:
- Finding aggregation transforms by node ID
- Handling incomplete batches during recovery
- Checking and flushing aggregation timeouts
- Flushing remaining aggregation buffers at end-of-source

All functions operate on external state passed via parameters - they don't
maintain internal state. This enables the Orchestrator to use them as
pure delegation targets.

    Called BEFORE processing each row to ensure timeouts fire during active
    processing, not just at end-of-source. Checking BEFORE buffering ensures
    timed-out batches don't include the newly arriving row.

    Before this was added, should_flush() was only called from buffer_row(),
    meaning timeouts never fired during idle periods between rows.

    KNOWN LIMITATION (True Idle):
    Timeouts fire when the next row arrives, not during "true idle" periods.
    If no rows arrive, buffered data will not flush until either:
    1. A new row arrives (triggering this timeout check), or
    2. The source completes (triggering flush_remaining_aggregation_buffers)

    Example: If timeout_seconds=5 and rows stop arriving at T=10, the batch
    won't flush until either a new row arrives or the source ends. For
    streaming sources that may never end, consider using count triggers or
    implementing periodic polling at the source level.

    Routing uses result.sink_name (set by on_success in the processor) rather
    than a default_sink_name parameter.

    Note: Checkpointing is NOT done here. Tokens routed to pending_tokens are
    only checkpointed after SinkExecutor.write() achieves sink durability,
