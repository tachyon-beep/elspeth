"""Pipeline configuration and result types.

These types define the interface for pipeline execution:
- PipelineConfig: Input configuration for a run
- RunResult: Output statistics from a run
- RouteValidationError: Configuration validation failure
- AggregationFlushResult: Result of flushing aggregation buffers

IMPORTANT: Import Cycle Prevention
----------------------------------
This module is a LEAF MODULE - it must NOT import from other orchestrator
submodules (validation.py, export.py, aggregation.py, core.py).

Other modules import FROM here (e.g., validation.py imports RouteValidationError).
If types.py were to import from those modules, a circular import would occur.

Keep types.py as pure data definitions with minimal dependencies.
