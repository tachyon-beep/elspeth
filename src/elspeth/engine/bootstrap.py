    This is the pre-execution phase that resolves ``depends_on`` sub-pipelines
    and evaluates ``commencement_gates``. Extracted so both the CLI and
    programmatic callers share the same codepath.

    Args:
        config: Validated pipeline settings (must already be loaded).
        settings_path: Path to the settings YAML — needed for cycle detection
            and dependency resolution (sub-pipelines resolve relative to this).
        probes: Pre-built collection probes for commencement gates. Required
            when ``commencement_gates`` is configured (raises ``FrameworkBugError``
            if None). Caller constructs these at L3 (where probe_factory lives).
        runner: Callback to execute sub-pipelines. Required when ``depends_on``
            is configured (raises ``FrameworkBugError`` if None). Injected from
            L3 to avoid L2→L3 import.

    Returns:
        PreflightResult if any dependencies or gates were configured, else None.
