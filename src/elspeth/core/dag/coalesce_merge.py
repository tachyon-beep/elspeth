# src/elspeth/core/dag/coalesce_merge.py
"""Coalesce merge logic for schema computation.

Extracted from builder.py to enable direct testing without reimplementation.
This module contains the core logic for merging schemas at coalesce points.

Two operations are provided:

1. merge_guaranteed_fields: Combines effective guarantees from branch schemas
   using union (require_all) or intersection (other policies).

2. merge_union_fields: Combines typed field definitions with policy-aware
   required/optional semantics for union merge strategy.

Both functions are called by builder.py during graph construction and can
be called directly by tests to verify semantics without reimplementing logic.

    """Merge typed fields from branch schemas using union merge strategy.

    Combines field definitions from all branches with policy-aware handling
    of required/optional semantics:

    - require_all (OR semantics): A field is required if required in ANY
      branch. Since all branches always arrive under require_all, any branch's
      guarantee is honored in the merged output.

    - other policies (AND semantics): A field is required only if required in
      ALL branches. Since some branches may be lost, only shared guarantees
      survive.

    Branch-exclusive fields (present in only one branch) are handled specially:
    - require_all: Preserve source branch's required flag (branch always arrives)
    - other policies: Force optional (branch may not arrive)

    Nullable semantics for shared fields depend on collision_policy (D5 fix):
    - first_wins: Use first branch's nullable (first branch's value always wins)
    - last_wins: Use last branch's nullable (last branch's value always wins)
    - fail: Use OR of all branches (conservative; collisions fail at runtime)

    Args:
        branch_schemas: Map of branch name to SchemaConfig
        require_all: If True, use OR semantics for required; if False, use AND
        collision_policy: How to resolve field-level collisions in union merge.
            Affects nullable computation for shared fields.
        branch_order: Declaration order of branches. If provided, branches are
            processed in this order for deterministic first/last semantics.
            If None, uses dict iteration order (insertion order in Python 3.7+).
        coalesce_id: Optional node ID for error messages (default: generic)
        guaranteed_fields: Pre-computed guaranteed_fields to include in result
        audit_fields: Pre-computed audit_fields to include in result

    Returns:
        Merged SchemaConfig. If all branches are observed-mode or no branches
        contribute fields, returns an observed-mode schema. Otherwise returns
        a flexible-mode schema with merged field definitions.
