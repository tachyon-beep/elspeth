"""Web security infrastructure for SSRF prevention and URL validation.

This module provides defense-in-depth against Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):

1. **Scheme validation**: Only HTTP/HTTPS allowed (blocks file://, ftp://, etc.)
2. **IP blocking**: Comprehensive blocklist covering private, loopback, metadata endpoints
3. **DNS rebinding prevention**: IP pinning via SSRFSafeRequest (resolve once, use that IP)

The key innovation is SSRFSafeRequest + validate_url_for_ssrf() which eliminates
the TOCTOU (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use) vulnerability in traditional SSRF defenses:

    # VULNERABLE (old pattern - resolved twice, attacker can return different IPs):
    # validate then httpx.get(url) → second DNS lookup → 169.254.169.254

    # SECURE (resolved once, IP pinned for connection):
    safe_request = validate_url_for_ssrf(url)  # Resolves and validates
    httpx.get(safe_request.connection_url, headers={"Host": safe_request.host_header})
