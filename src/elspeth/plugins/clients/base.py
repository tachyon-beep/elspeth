    Provides common infrastructure for tracking external calls:

    - State ID linking calls to the current processing state
    - Call index counter for ordering multiple calls within a state

    Subclasses implement specific client protocols (LLM, HTTP, etc.)

        The _next_call_index method is thread-safe. Multiple threads can

        call indices, which is essential for pooled execution scenarios.
