"""Orchestrator plugins - define data flow topology.

TODO (FEAT-002): protocols.py will be DELETED and moved to core/base/protocols.py in the namespace
                 reorganization (BREAKING CHANGE - pre-1.0). __init__.py will remain as lazy import shim
                 for ExperimentRunner (avoids circular dependencies).
                 See docs/implementation/FEAT-002-namespace-reorganization.md
                 Expected: Post VULN-004 + FEAT-001 merge
