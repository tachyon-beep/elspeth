"""LLM provider protocol and response DTOs.

The LLMProvider protocol defines the narrow interface between LLMTransform
(shared logic) and provider-specific transport (Azure SDK, OpenRouter HTTP).

Providers are responsible for:
1. Client lifecycle (creation, caching per state_id, cleanup)
2. LLM API calls (transport-specific)
3. Tier 3 boundary validation (response parsing, NaN rejection)
4. Error classification (raising typed exceptions)
5. Audit trail recording (via their Audited*Client)
6. Finish reason normalization (provider-specific → FinishReason enum)

The transform above the provider never sees raw SDK/HTTP responses.
raw_response is NOT on LLMQueryResult — providers record audit data
via their Audited*Client (D2 from architecture remediation).
