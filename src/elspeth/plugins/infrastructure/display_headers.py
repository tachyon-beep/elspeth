"""Display header resolution for sink plugins.

Provides shared display header infrastructure used by CSV, JSON, and Azure Blob
sinks. The functions in this module operate on sink instances that have been
initialized with init_display_headers().

Design: Functions rather than mixin class. This avoids MRO complexity and makes
the dependency on sink state explicit. Each function takes the sink instance as
its first argument, typed via DisplayHeaderHost protocol.

Ordering requirement: The host sink MUST have _output_contract already
initialized (by BaseSink.__init__) BEFORE calling init_display_headers().
init_display_headers() asserts this precondition.

State attributes set by init_display_headers():
    _headers_mode: HeaderMode — which header mode is active
    _headers_custom_mapping: dict | None — explicit field→display mapping (CUSTOM mode)
    _resolved_display_headers: dict | None — lazily populated from Landscape (ORIGINAL mode)
    _display_headers_resolved: bool — guard flag for lazy resolution
