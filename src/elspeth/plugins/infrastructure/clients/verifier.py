"""Call verifier for verify mode - compares live vs recorded responses.

In verify mode, instead of simply replaying recorded responses, the CallVerifier
makes live external calls and compares them against previously recorded responses
from the audit trail. This enables:

- Detecting drift between current API behavior and recorded baselines
- Validating that external services still return expected results
- Catching breaking changes in API responses before they affect production

The verifier uses DeepDiff for flexible comparison with configurable exclusions.
