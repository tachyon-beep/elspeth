"""Base classes for plugin implementations.

These provide common functionality and ensure proper interface compliance.
Plugins MUST subclass these base classes (BaseSource, BaseTransform, BaseSink).
Gate routing is handled by config-driven GateSettings + ExpressionParser, not plugin classes.

Why base class inheritance is required:
- Plugin discovery uses issubclass() checks against base classes
- Python's Protocol with non-method members (name, determinism, etc.) cannot
  support issubclass() - only isinstance() on already-instantiated objects
- Base classes enforce self-consistency via __init_subclass__ hooks
- Per CLAUDE.md "Plugin Ownership", all plugins are system code, not user extensions

The protocol definitions (SourceProtocol, TransformProtocol, SinkProtocol) exist
for type-checking purposes only - they define the interface contract but cannot
be used for runtime discovery.

Lifecycle Contract (all hooks called on main thread by orchestrator):
    on_start(ctx) -> [process/load/write] -> on_complete(ctx) -> close()

- on_start: Per-run initialization (acquire resources, capture context).
  If on_start raises, neither on_complete nor close is called.
- on_complete: Processing finished (success or error). Receives LifecycleContext
  for landscape/telemetry interaction. Called even on pipeline crash.
- close: Pure resource teardown (no context). Called even on pipeline
  crash. Each plugin's cleanup is individually protected.
- Call order across plugin types (normal run):
  source.on_start -> transforms.on_start -> sinks.on_start -> [processing]
  -> transforms.on_complete -> sinks.on_complete -> source.on_complete
  -> source.close -> transforms.close -> sinks.close
- Resume runs skip source lifecycle entirely (NullSource is used).

    """Base class for all row transforms.

    Execution Models
    ----------------
    Transforms use one of three execution models depending on concurrency needs.
    The TransformExecutor in engine/executors/transform.py dispatches automatically
    based on isinstance checks (BatchTransformMixin) and the is_batch_aware flag.

    **1. Synchronous (process) -- standard row-by-row processing**

        The engine calls process() once per row and receives a TransformResult
        synchronously. Use this for CPU-bound, fast, or deterministic transforms
        (field mapping, truncation, validation, etc.).

        class MyTransform(BaseTransform):
            name = "my_transform"
            input_schema = InputSchema
            output_schema = OutputSchema

            def process(self, row: PipelineRow, ctx: TransformContext) -> TransformResult:
                return TransformResult.success(
                    {**row.to_dict(), "new_field": "value"},
                    success_reason={"action": "processed"},
                )

    **2. Streaming (accept) -- row-level pipelining via BatchTransformMixin**

        The engine calls accept() per row. Processing happens asynchronously in a
        worker pool; results are emitted in FIFO order through an OutputPort. The
        engine blocks until each row's result arrives (sequential across rows,
        concurrent within each row). Use this for I/O-bound transforms that benefit
        from concurrency (LLM calls, HTTP APIs, multi-query evaluation).

        Requires inheriting both BaseTransform and BatchTransformMixin:

        class MyLLMTransform(BaseTransform, BatchTransformMixin):
            name = "my_llm"

            def accept(self, row: PipelineRow, ctx: TransformContext) -> None:
                self.accept_row(row, ctx, self._do_work)

            def connect_output(self, output: OutputPort, max_pending: int = 30) -> None:
                self.init_batch_processing(max_pending=max_pending, output=output)

            def _do_work(self, row: PipelineRow, ctx: TransformContext) -> TransformResult:
                # Runs in worker thread
                return TransformResult.success(...)

        Streaming transforms override process() to raise NotImplementedError,
        directing callers to use accept(). The TransformExecutor detects the mixin
        via isinstance(transform, BatchTransformMixin) and routes to accept()
        automatically -- plugin authors never need to worry about dispatch.

    **3. Batch-aware (process with is_batch_aware=True) -- aggregation batches**

        The engine buffers rows until an aggregation trigger fires, then calls
        process() with list[PipelineRow]. Use this for transforms inside
        aggregation nodes (batch LLM calls, statistical aggregations).

        class MyBatchTransform(BaseTransform):
            name = "my_batch"
            is_batch_aware = True

            def process(self, row, ctx):  # row is list[PipelineRow] in batch mode
                if isinstance(row, list):
                    return self._process_batch(row, ctx)
                return self._process_single(row, ctx)

    When to Use Which
    -----------------
    - process() alone: Simple, fast transforms (field mapping, filtering, etc.)
    - accept() + BatchTransformMixin: I/O-bound per-row work needing concurrency
      (LLM API calls, HTTP requests, multi-query evaluation)
    - process() + is_batch_aware: Aggregation-stage transforms that receive
      pre-buffered batches from the engine's trigger system
