"""Mixin for transforms that process rows concurrently with FIFO output ordering.

Transforms using this mixin can process multiple rows concurrently while
guaranteeing FIFO output order. The orchestrator sees simple accept() calls;
concurrency is hidden inside the plugin.

Key principle: The transform doesn't know what's downstream. It just emits
to its output port. Could be a sink, could be another transform.

class BatchTransformMixin:
    """Mixin that adds concurrent sub-task processing to any transform.

    This mixin enables processing work items concurrently within a single row
    while guaranteeing FIFO output order. From the orchestrator's perspective,
    accept() takes work and may block on backpressure. Results flow through
    the output port in submission order.

    Concurrency Model (IMPORTANT):
        - WITHIN-ROW concurrency: Worker threads process sub-tasks concurrently
          (e.g., multi-query transforms make 10+ LLM calls per row in parallel)
        - ACROSS-ROW sequencing: The TransformExecutor blocks on each row's
          completion before processing the next row (see executors.py for rationale)
        - Buffer capacity: The RowReorderBuffer can queue work when multiple
          submissions happen before the orchestrator waits

    Architecture:
        Orchestrator → accept() → [RowReorderBuffer] → [Worker Pool] → emit() → Output

    The transform doesn't know if its output goes to a sink or another transform.
    It just emits to the output port.

    Thread Model:
        - Orchestrator thread: calls accept(), may block on backpressure
        - Worker threads: execute processing, call complete() when done
        - Release thread: calls wait_for_next_release(), emits to output port
