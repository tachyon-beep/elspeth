    Exporters ship telemetry events to external observability platforms.
    They are discovered via pluggy hooks and configured via pipeline settings.

    Lifecycle:
        1. Discovery: elspeth_get_exporters hook returns exporter classes
        2. Instantiation: TelemetryManager creates instances
        3. Configuration: configure() called with exporter-specific settings
        4. Operation: export() called for each event (must not raise)
        5. Shutdown: flush() then close() called at pipeline end

    Error handling:
        - configure() MUST raise TelemetryExporterError on invalid config
        - export() MUST NOT raise - log errors and continue
        - close() MUST be idempotent - safe to call multiple times

        Implementations may buffer events for batch export. Use flush() to

        Thread Safety:
            export() is always called from the telemetry export thread, never
            concurrently with itself. However, export() may run on a different
            thread than configure() and close(). Implementations should not
