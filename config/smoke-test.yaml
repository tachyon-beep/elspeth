# smoke-test.yaml - Minimal Pipeline for Deployment Verification
#
# This configuration is used by deployment scripts and CI/CD pipelines
# to verify that ELSPETH is properly installed and functional.
#
# The null source yields no rows, so this pipeline completes immediately
# while still exercising the core engine components:
#   - Configuration loading and validation
#   - Plugin discovery and initialization
#   - Landscape database connection
#   - Pipeline execution flow
#
# Usage:
#   elspeth validate --settings config/smoke-test.yaml
#   elspeth run --settings config/smoke-test.yaml --execute

# Source: null source yields no rows (instant completion)
datasource:
  plugin: "null"

# Sink: JSON output for verification
sinks:
  output:
    plugin: json
    options:
      path: /app/output/smoke-test-output.json

# Default output sink
output_sink: output

# Landscape: SQLite database for audit trail
landscape:
  url: ${DATABASE_URL:-sqlite:////app/state/landscape.db}

# Payload store: filesystem storage
payload_store:
  base_path: /app/state/payloads

# Concurrency: single worker for smoke test
concurrency:
  max_workers: 1
