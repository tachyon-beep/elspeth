"""N2 Layer A harness — every registered DeclarationContract MUST have a
``positive_example_does_not_apply`` scenario; ``applies_to`` MUST return False
on it; and (belt-and-suspenders) ``runtime_check`` MUST NOT raise the
contract's violation on it.

Closes the "negative_example coverage illusion" identified by the H2 panel
(systems-thinker R2 loop): the existing ``negative_example`` harness tests
the positive case (contract fires when it should). Before N2 there was no
coverage for the complementary case (contract does NOT fire when
preconditions are absent). A contract with a buggy ``applies_to`` that
returned True for the wrong plugin kind would fire in the wrong context and
mis-attribute the violation — the Landscape legal record would carry a
violation from contract X against a plugin X was never designed to cover.

See issue elspeth-50509ed2bc and the panel synthesis comment on
elspeth-425047a599.
