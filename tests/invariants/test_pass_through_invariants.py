"""Governance harness for ADR-009 §Clause 4 — pass-through annotation invariants.

Three tests here:

- **Forward invariant** (`test_annotated_transforms_preserve_input_fields`):
  For every registered ``passes_through_input=True`` transform, runs
  Hypothesis-generated probe rows through ``process()`` and asserts every
  emitted row preserves every input field (contract AND payload). Fails CI
  on mis-annotation.

- **Backward invariant** (``test_non_pass_through_transforms_do_drop_fields``):
  Fails CI when a non-annotated transform that opted into probing (i.e.
  implements ``probe_config()``) preserves all input fields on every probe
  row. Remediation is either adding ``passes_through_input=True`` or
  supplying a ``probe_config()`` that exercises a case the transform
  demonstrably does not preserve.

- **Skip-rate budget** (``test_harness_skip_rate_budget``): asserts
  ``skip_rate ≤ 25%`` across the annotated plugin set. Track 2 additions
  that slip the budget must implement ``probe_config()`` per the contract.

The harness uses ``pytest_generate_tests`` to parametrize over registered
transforms at collection time — with a guard that crashes if the plugin
list is empty (silent "0 tests" passes are the worst kind of theatre).
