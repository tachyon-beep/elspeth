"""Meta-test for the ADR-009 §Clause 4 forward invariant.

Registers a deliberately mis-annotated fixture transform and asserts the
harness catches it. Without this, a refactor that accidentally empties the
discovery list — or that weakens the forward-invariant assertion itself —
would silently make the harness a no-op. That is the worst kind of
governance theatre: a test that always passes regardless of underlying
reality.

The test drives the live ``test_annotated_transforms_preserve_input_fields``
function rather than reimplementing its assertion logic. This means:

- A regression that weakens the assertion (e.g. removes the ``not dropped``
  check) fails this test, because the live function would no longer raise
  on the deliberately-broken fixture.
- A regression that breaks discovery (e.g. ``_annotated_pass_through_plugins``
  returns the wrong list) fails this test, because the fixture would never
  reach the parametrize.
- A regression that breaks probe-row generation (e.g. ``probe_row()`` only
  generates 0-field or 1-field rows) is detected indirectly: the fixture
  drops fields only when 2+ are present, so a too-narrow strategy would
  cause the assertion never to fire.

Earlier versions of this self-test reimplemented the assertion logic
inline; that version would still pass if the live function's assertion
was broken but the duplicate logic remained correct. The current shape
closes that gap by invoking the live function directly.
