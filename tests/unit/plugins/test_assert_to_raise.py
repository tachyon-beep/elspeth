# tests/unit/plugins/test_assert_to_raise.py
"""Verify assert-to-raise conversions across plugin files.

18 assert statements were replaced with explicit RuntimeError raises across
8 plugin files.  These tests cover the three most common guard patterns:

1. ``_recorder is None`` before ``_create_provider()`` fires
   (LLMTransform unified guard, and the same pattern in AzureContentSafety)

2. ``_writer / _file is None`` invariants inside CSVSink.write()
   (guards that protect against internal state bugs)

3. ``connect_output() already called`` double-initialisation guard
   (AzureContentSafety — LLMTransform already had this covered)

Each test constructs the *minimum* plugin instance required to reach the
guard, leaves the precondition violated, and asserts RuntimeError is raised
with the expected message substring.
