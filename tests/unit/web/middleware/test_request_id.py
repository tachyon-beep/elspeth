"""Tests for the request-id middleware.

The middleware assigns a correlation id to every inbound HTTP request so
that exception handlers, structured log events, and the client-facing
response share one id.  Operators can pair an error report to its slog
event with a single lookup, closing the support-ticket triage round trip.

Security boundary: the middleware MUST reject or regenerate a
caller-supplied ``X-Request-ID`` that looks suspicious (too long, wrong
shape) — otherwise an attacker can spoof the log-correlation field to
frame requests they did not make.
