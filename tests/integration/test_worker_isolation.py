"""Integration tests for worker process isolation.

These tests verify that plugin workers running as UID 1002 (appplugin)
cannot access sidecar daemon resources owned by UID 1001 (sidecar).

Note: UID-based isolation tests require container environment with:
- User 'sidecar' (UID 1001) owning /run/sidecar/
- User 'appplugin' (UID 1002) for workers
- User 'appuser' (UID 1000) for orchestrator

In development environment (same UID), these tests create mock files
and verify permission checks are in place (test-only markers).
