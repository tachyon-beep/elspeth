"""Regression tests for COMPLETED outcome timing relative to sink durability.

These tests guard against a previously-fixed bug where COMPLETED token outcomes
were recorded BEFORE sink writes happened. This violated the token outcome
contract (docs/contracts/token-outcomes/00-token-outcome-contract.md):

- Invariant 3: "COMPLETED implies the token has a completed sink node_state"
- Invariant 4: "Completed sink node_state implies a COMPLETED token_outcome with sink_name"

The fix ensured COMPLETED outcomes are only recorded AFTER successful sink writes.
These tests verify the CORRECT behavior to prevent regression.
