# Markdown File Cleanup Report

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Analysis Scope:** All .md files in repository
**Security Check:** ✅ No secrets found in tracked files

---

## 🚨 Priority Security Check

**Status:** ✅ **PASS** - No security issues found

The following files contain credentials but are **properly gitignored** and not tracked:
- `orchestration_packs/trading-cards-demo/blob_store.yaml` (Azure SAS token)
- `orchestration_packs/trading-cards-demo/mtg_dynamic_lookup_azure.yaml` (Azure API keys)

These are local configuration files for development/testing and are correctly excluded from version control.

## 📋 Recommended Removals

### Category 1: Completed Analysis Documents (Root Level)

These are temporary analysis documents created during recent refactoring work (Oct 15-16, 2025). The work is complete and documented in git history.

**Recommend REMOVAL:**
1. `ARCHITECTURE_CONSOLIDATION_PROPOSAL.md` (13KB) - Proposal for experiment plugin consolidation
2. `CORE_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` (14KB) - Core directory decomposition analysis
3. `DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md` (28KB) - Duplication analysis report
4. `DUPLICATION_PHASE1_COMPLETE.md` (8.8KB) - Phase 1 completion report
5. `DUPLICATION_PHASE2_COMPLETE.md` (14KB) - Phase 2 completion report
6. `DUPLICATION_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md` (15KB) - Final summary of duplication work
7. `SRC_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` (26KB) - Source directory analysis
8. `FEATURE_COMPARISON.md` (16KB) - Feature comparison analysis

**Total:** ~135KB, 8 files

**Rationale:**
- Work is complete (marked with ✅)
- Information preserved in git history
- Findings implemented in code
- Not needed for ongoing development or operations

**Alternative:** Archive to `docs/archive/analyses/2025-10-refactoring/` if historical reference is desired

---

### Category 2: Completed Planning Documents (docs/)

**Recommend REVIEW (possibly archive):**
1. `docs/SHOULD_FIX_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (large, detailed execution plan)
2. `docs/SHOULD_FIX_SUMMARY.md` (executive summary of should-fix items)

**Status:** Planning phase documents from Oct 15, 2025

**Rationale:**
- These MAY still be relevant for future work
- Review content to determine if work is complete or ongoing
- If work is complete, archive to `docs/archive/planning/`
- If work is ongoing, keep in active docs

**Action Required:** User should confirm if should-fix work is complete or in progress

---

### Category 3: Potentially Obsolete Documentation

**Files to REVIEW:**

1. `docs/DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT_2025-10-12.md` - Documentation audit from Oct 12
   - Check if findings have been addressed
   - If complete, archive or remove

2. `docs/roadmap/completed/refactoring-2025/` directory (9 files)
   - Work is marked as "completed"
   - Consider moving entire directory to `docs/archive/roadmap-2025-refactoring/`

3. `docs/roadmap/completed/data-flow-migration/` directory (15+ files)
   - Work is marked as "completed"
   - Contains `.context/` subdirectory with session state
   - Consider archiving entire migration documentation

---

### Category 4: Generated Output Files

**Recommend REMOVAL (or add to .gitignore):**

1. `outputs/sample_suite_reports/consolidated/executive_summary.md` - Generated report
2. `outputs/trading-cards-demo/reports/analytics_report.md` - Generated report

**Rationale:**
- These are generated outputs, not source documentation
- Should be in .gitignore, not tracked
- Can be regenerated anytime

---

### Category 5: Configuration Templates

**Keep (but review):**

1. `config/templates/README.md` - Template documentation
2. `config/templates/production_experiment.yaml` - Production template
3. `config/templates/production_suite.yaml` - Production template

**Recommendation:** Review for completeness and accuracy, but KEEP these as they provide value to users

---

## 🔧 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Low Risk)
1. **Remove root-level analysis documents** (8 files)
   ```bash
   git rm ARCHITECTURE_CONSOLIDATION_PROPOSAL.md \
          CORE_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md \
          DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md \
          DUPLICATION_PHASE1_COMPLETE.md \
          DUPLICATION_PHASE2_COMPLETE.md \
          DUPLICATION_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md \
          SRC_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md \
          FEATURE_COMPARISON.md
   ```

2. **Add outputs to .gitignore** (if not already there)
   ```bash
   echo "outputs/*.md" >> .gitignore
   echo "outputs/**/*.md" >> .gitignore
   ```

### Short-term (Requires Review)
3. **Review should-fix documents** - Determine if work is complete
4. **Archive completed roadmap items** - Move to docs/archive/
5. **Archive completed migration docs** - Move to docs/archive/

### Optional (Historical Preservation)
6. **Create archive structure** for removed analysis documents:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/archive/analyses/2025-10-refactoring
   git mv <files> docs/archive/analyses/2025-10-refactoring/
   ```

## ✅ Security Clearance

**No secrets or credentials found in tracked files.**

All sensitive data is properly stored in gitignored configuration files as expected.

---

## 📝 Notes

- This analysis excluded `.venv`, `.tox`, `node_modules`, and `pytest_cache` directories
- All recommendations preserve information in git history
- Archive structure already exists at `docs/archive/` with subdirectories for audits and dev-notes
- Current archive has good organization - consider using same pattern for new archives

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this report
2. Approve immediate removals
3. Provide guidance on should-fix status
4. Execute cleanup in phases with testing between each phase
