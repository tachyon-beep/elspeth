# Build dependencies lockfile for --no-build-isolation
#
# This file contains minimal build system requirements (setuptools + wheel)
# needed before installing from requirements*.lock files with --no-build-isolation.
#
# Why needed: pip's --no-build-isolation flag prevents pip from creating temporary
# virtual environments during builds (required for hermetic, reproducible builds).
# This requires build backends to be pre-installed in the target environment.
#
# To regenerate:
#   python -m pip download setuptools wheel --dest /tmp/build-deps --no-deps
#   python -m pip hash /tmp/build-deps/*.whl
#
# Security: All packages are hash-pinned for supply chain integrity (AIS compliance).
