## Current Phase: Phase 0 - Security Properties & Threat Model

### Tasks
- [ ] Define security invariants (1 hour)
  - [ ] `test_INVARIANT_orchestrator_operates_at_minimum_level`
  - [ ] `test_INVARIANT_high_security_plugins_reject_low_envelope`
  - [ ] `test_INVARIANT_classification_uplifting_automatic`
  - [ ] Create `tests/test_adr002_invariants.py`
- [ ] Write threat model documentation (30 min)
  - [ ] Create `THREAT_MODEL.md`
  - [ ] Document T1: Classification breach
  - [ ] Document T2: Security downgrade attack
  - [ ] Document T3: Runtime bypass
  - [ ] Document T4: Classification mislabeling
  - [ ] Document out-of-scope threats (certification handles)
- [ ] Risk assessment (30 min)
  - [ ] Identify implementation risks
  - [ ] Document mitigations
  - [ ] Add to THREAT_MODEL.md

### Blockers
- None

### Notes
- Working directory created: `ADR002_IMPLEMENTATION/`
- Methodology adapted from PR #11 success
- Starting with test-first approach per methodology

## Daily Log

### 2025-10-25 (Day 1)

**Time**: 0h

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Merged PR #11 (suite_runner.py refactoring)
- ‚úÖ Created branch `feature/adr-002-security-enforcement`
- ‚úÖ Created working directory `ADR002_IMPLEMENTATION/`
- ‚úÖ Adapted methodology from PR #11
- ‚úÖ Set up tracking infrastructure

**Next Session**:
- Start Phase 0: Security invariants & threat model
- Create tests/test_adr002_invariants.py with failing tests
- Write THREAT_MODEL.md

**Blockers**: None

**Notes**:
- Methodology adapted successfully from PR #11 refactoring approach
- Test-first strategy: Write security invariants BEFORE implementation
- Target: 6-10 hours total over 1-2 days
