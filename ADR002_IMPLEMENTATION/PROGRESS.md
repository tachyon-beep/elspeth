## Daily Log

### 2025-10-25 (Day 1)

**Time**: 0h

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Merged PR #11 (suite_runner.py refactoring)
- ‚úÖ Created branch `feature/adr-002-security-enforcement`
- ‚úÖ Created working directory `ADR002_IMPLEMENTATION/`
- ‚úÖ Adapted methodology from PR #11
- ‚úÖ Set up tracking infrastructure

**Next Session**:
- Start Phase 0: Security invariants & threat model
- Create tests/test_adr002_invariants.py with failing tests
- Write THREAT_MODEL.md

**Blockers**: None

**Notes**:
- Methodology adapted successfully from PR #11 refactoring approach
- Test-first strategy: Write security invariants BEFORE implementation
- Target: 6-10 hours total over 1-2 days

## Lessons Learned

(Will be updated as implementation progresses)

### 2025-10-25 - Phase 0 Complete ‚úÖ

**Time**: 1.5 hours

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ THREAT_MODEL.md created (4 threats, 6 implementation risks)
- ‚úÖ tests/test_adr002_invariants.py created (14 security invariant tests)
- ‚úÖ tests/test_adr002_properties.py created (10 property tests √ó 500-1000 examples)
- ‚úÖ All threats mapped to defense layers
- ‚úÖ Risk assessment complete with mitigations

**Test Status**:
- 14 invariant tests (expected to FAIL - no implementation yet)
- 10 property tests with 7500+ examples total
- All tests use `@pytest.mark.skipif` for test-first workflow

**Key Insights**:
- T1 (Classification Breach) has 3-layer defense
- T2 (Security Downgrade) must be caught by certification
- Highest risk: R2 (False Positives) - some valid configs may be blocked
- Comprehensive property testing will find edge cases

**Next**: Phase 1 - Implement core security primitives to make tests green

### 2025-10-25 - Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ

**Time**: 1 hour

- ‚úÖ ClassifiedDataFrame implemented (136 lines)
  - Frozen dataclass with immutable classification
  - Automatic uplifting via max() operation
  - Runtime validation failsafe
  - 5/5 tests passing

- ‚úÖ Minimum Clearance Envelope (compute_minimum_clearance_envelope)
  - Weakest-link principle implementation
  - Returns MIN(all plugin security levels)
  - Empty list defaults to UNOFFICIAL
  - 4/4 tests passing

- ‚úÖ BasePlugin Protocol
  - get_security_level() abstract method
  - validate_can_operate_at_level() validation method
  - Added to protocols.py with full documentation
  - 3/3 tests passing

- ‚úÖ SecurityValidationError exception
  - Added to validation/base.py
  - Used by all validation methods
  - 2/2 property tests passing

**Test Status**:
- 14/14 security invariant tests PASSING (GREEN) ‚úÖ
- All Phase 1 tests complete
- MyPy clean ‚úÖ
- Ruff clean ‚úÖ

**Files Modified/Created**:
```
A  src/elspeth/core/security/classified_data.py (NEW - 136 lines)
M  src/elspeth/core/base/protocols.py (+51 lines - BasePlugin protocol)
M  src/elspeth/core/experiments/suite_runner.py (+37 lines - envelope func)
M  src/elspeth/core/security/__init__.py (+1 export)
M  src/elspeth/core/validation/base.py (+13 lines - SecurityValidationError)
M  tests/test_adr002_invariants.py (-9 lines - removed skipif decorators)
```

**Key Insights**:
- Test-first discipline working perfectly (RED ‚Üí GREEN workflow)
- Frozen dataclass + max() provides strong immutability guarantees
- MIN envelope computation is elegant (3 lines of logic)
- BasePlugin protocol integrates cleanly with existing protocols

**Next**: Phase 2 - Suite Runner Integration (start-time validation)
