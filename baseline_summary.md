# Baseline State Before runner.py Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Branch:** refactor/sonar-code-quality
**Target File:** `src/elspeth/core/experiments/runner.py`

---

## Overview

This document captures the state of the codebase **before** starting the refactoring of `ExperimentRunner.run()` and related methods. The refactoring targets the most complex function in the Elspeth codebase (complexity 73) to bring it under the target threshold of 15.

## Code Quality Metrics

### File Statistics
- **Total Lines:** 765
- **Cognitive Complexity (run method):** 73 (CRITICAL - target: <15)
- **Other Complex Methods:**
  - `_run_row_processing`: Complexity 45
  - `run_aggregation`: Complexity 26

## Test Categories

### Characterization Tests (6)
These tests document the current behavioral invariants that must be preserved:

1. **test_run_result_structure** - Verifies result dictionary structure
2. **test_run_preserves_dataframe_order** - Ensures row order maintained
3. **test_run_checkpoint_idempotency** - Validates checkpoint skipping
4. **test_run_early_stop_terminates_processing** - Confirms early stop behavior
5. **test_run_aggregator_receives_complete_results** - Checks aggregator integration
6. **test_run_single_failure_doesnt_block_others** - Verifies failure isolation

### Safety Tests (3)
These tests cover edge cases and error conditions:

1. **test_run_with_empty_dataframe** - Empty input handling
2. **test_run_with_concurrent_execution** - Parallel processing correctness
3. **test_run_with_failing_aggregator** - Aggregator exception behavior

## SonarQube Issues (from sonar_issues_triaged.md)

### Critical Complexity Issues
- **runner.py:75** (run_experiment) - Complexity 73 ⚠️ **PRIMARY TARGET**
- **runner.py:557** (_run_row_processing) - Complexity 45
- Total critical complexity issues in runner.py: 2 functions

### Impact
- Very difficult to maintain
- High risk of bugs during modifications
- Testing challenges due to complex control flow

---

## Success Criteria for Refactoring

The refactoring will be considered successful when:

1. **All 9 tests still pass** ✅
2. **Coverage remains ≥71%** ✅
3. **MyPy continues to pass** ✅
4. **run() complexity reduced to <15** (from 73)
5. **Helper method complexity <10** (each)
6. **No behavioral changes** (characterization tests prove this)

## Files Changed Since Baseline

### Test Files (New)
- `tests/test_runner_characterization.py` - 259 lines
- `tests/test_runner_safety.py` - 91 lines

### Documentation Files
- `EXECUTION_PLAN_runner_refactor.md` - Complete refactoring plan
- `sonar_issues_triaged.md` - SonarQube triage report
- `refactor_plan_runner_run.md` - Detailed refactoring strategy
- `risk_mitigation_runner_refactor.md` - Risk assessment

## Baseline Artifacts

The following files preserve the exact pre-refactoring state:

1. **baseline_tests.txt** - Full test suite output (9 tests passing)
2. **baseline_coverage.txt** - Coverage report text output
3. **baseline_coverage/** - HTML coverage report directory
4. **baseline_mypy.txt** - MyPy type checking results
5. **baseline_lines.txt** - Line count of runner.py (765 lines)
6. **baseline_summary.md** - This document

---

## Key Technical Discoveries

During characterization test development, we discovered:

1. **Result Structure:** Results use `row` key (not `context`) for row data
2. **Checkpoint Format:** Plain text format, one ID per line (not JSON)
3. **Aggregator Exceptions:** Propagate to caller (not caught internally)
4. **Failure Structure:** Contains `row`, `retry`, and error information
5. **Metadata Fields:** Includes `retry_summary` with exhausted count

---

## Next Steps

With the safety net in place, proceed to:

1. **Phase 1:** Create supporting classes (CheckpointManager, dataclasses)
2. **Phase 2:** Extract simple helper methods (retry, security, prompts, aggregation)
3. **Phase 3:** Extract complex helper methods (row preparation, processing, metadata, sinks)
4. **Phase 4:** Refactor main run() method to Template Method pattern
5. **Phase 5:** Validate with baseline comparison and benchmarks

**Baseline Captured By:** Claude Code
**Refactoring Target:** Reduce complexity from 73 to <15
**Safety Net Status:** ✅ Complete (9 tests, 71% coverage)
