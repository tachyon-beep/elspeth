# Sudoers configuration for Elspeth orchestrator
#
# Allow appuser (UID 1000, orchestrator) to spawn plugin workers
# as appplugin (UID 1002) without password prompt.
#
# Security: This is intentional privilege separation, not escalation.
# Workers run with FEWER privileges than orchestrator (no sidecar access).
#
# Install to: /etc/sudoers.d/elspeth
# Permissions: 0440 (read-only, owned by root)

# Allow appuser to run Python worker process as appplugin
