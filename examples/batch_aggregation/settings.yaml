# ELSPETH Aggregation Example Pipeline
#
# This pipeline demonstrates batch aggregation by computing statistics
# over groups of transactions. Each batch of 5 rows is aggregated into
# a single summary row with count, sum, and mean.
#
# Run with:
#   uv run elspeth run -s examples/batch_aggregation/settings.yaml --execute
