## Recommended Strategy: Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Before ATO Submission (5 days)

**Goal:** Complete critical items for ATO package

1. **SF-5: Documentation Improvements** (2 days)
   - Update architecture docs (remove legacy references)
   - Create operations runbooks (deployment, incident response)
   - Update user documentation (CLAUDE.md, guides)
   - **Create ATO documentation package** ‚Üê CRITICAL

2. **SF-1: Artifact Encryption** (2 days)
   - Implement AES-256-GCM encryption for artifacts
   - Create decryption CLI tool
   - Integrate with existing signed_artifact sink
   - Enhances security posture for ATO

3. **SF-4: CLI Safety Improvements** (1 day)
   - Add `--dry-run` flag (preview without side effects)
   - Add confirmation prompts for risky operations
   - Improve error messages with helpful guidance

**Phase 1 Total:** 5 days
**ATO Value:** Complete documentation + enhanced security + better UX

### Phase 2: After ATO Approval (5 days)

**Goal:** Operational excellence and performance

4. **SF-3: Enhanced Monitoring** (2 days)
   - OpenTelemetry integration
   - Grafana/Azure Monitor dashboards
   - Alerting rules for production

5. **SF-2: Performance Optimization** (3 days)
   - Streaming data processing (handle 1M+ rows)
   - Memory-bounded processing
   - Constant memory usage regardless of dataset size

**Phase 2 Total:** 5 days
**Value:** Production-ready monitoring + large-scale processing

---

## Alternative Strategy: Minimum ATO Path

If timeline is extremely tight:

**Option A: Documentation Only (2 days)**
- Complete SF-5 only
- Defer SF-1, SF-4, SF-3, SF-2 to post-ATO
- **Risk:** Reduced security posture, no operational improvements before deployment

**Option B: Documentation + Encryption (4 days)**
- Complete SF-5 + SF-1
- Demonstrates strong security posture
- Defer SF-4, SF-3, SF-2 to post-ATO
- **Recommended minimum** for ATO

**Option C: All Before ATO (10 days)**
- Complete all 5 Should-Fix items
- Maximum ATO value
- Full operational readiness
- **Recommended if timeline permits**

- Quick 1-day implementation

**Deliverables:**
- `--dry-run` flag (preview without side effects)
- Confirmation prompts for risky operations (external sinks, large LLM calls)
- `--yes` flag to bypass for automation
- Improved error messages with context and documentation links

**Impact:** Reduces operational accidents

---

### SF-3: Enhanced Monitoring üìä

**Why Needed:**
- Production visibility and observability
- Enables proactive issue detection
- Supports incident response

**Deliverables:**
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Metrics: latency, error rate, cost, security events
- Grafana dashboard (pre-built)
- Azure Monitor queries
- Alerting rules

**Impact:** Operational readiness for production

---

### SF-2: Performance Optimization üöÄ

**Why Useful:**
- Enables large-scale processing (1M+ rows)
- Current implementation handles typical workloads well
- Can be deferred to post-ATO if needed

**Deliverables:**
- Streaming datasource (processes chunks, not full dataset)
- Memory-bounded processing (constant memory usage)
- Checkpoint/resume for long-running jobs
- Memory monitoring and warnings

**Impact:** Scalability for large workloads

### For Maximum ATO Value
**Execute All 10 Days:**
- Complete all 5 Should-Fix items
- Demonstrate comprehensive operational readiness
- Full monitoring and observability
- Large-scale processing capabilities

### For Minimum ATO Path (Timeline Risk)
**Execute SF-5 Only (2 days):**
- Documentation package for ATO submission
- Defer all other Should-Fix items to post-ATO

## Next Actions

1. **Review this plan** with ATO sponsor
2. **Choose strategy:** Phase 1 only, All 10 days, or Minimum path
3. **Assign resources** if multiple developers available
4. **Begin with SF-5** (Documentation) - highest priority
5. **Track progress** in ATO_PROGRESS.md

---

## Questions for Decision

1. **Timeline:** How much time before ATO submission? (5 days? 10 days? 2 days?)
2. **Priorities:** Is security (SF-1) or operations (SF-3, SF-2) more important?
3. **Resources:** Single developer or team? (Can parallelize if multiple devs)
4. **Risk Tolerance:** Prefer minimal scope or comprehensive delivery?

**Recommendation:** Phase 1 approach (5 days) balances ATO readiness with timeline
