## Executive Summary

**Approach**: Atheris coverage-guided fuzzing for top 3 security-critical modules
**Timeline**: 5-6 weeks, 40-80 hours (after Python 3.12 support)
**Value**: Discover unknown edge cases that property testing misses

**Key difference from Phase 1**:
- **Phase 1 (Hypothesis)**: Tests known invariants you specify
- **Phase 2 (Atheris)**: Discovers unknown bugs through coverage-guided exploration

---

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting Phase 2, ALL must be TRUE:

- [ ] **Phase 1 operational**: Hypothesis fuzzing running in CI, â‰¥15 property tests
- [ ] **Phase 1 demonstrates value**: â‰¥2 security bugs found (S0-S2)
- [ ] **Atheris supports Python 3.12**: Check `pip install atheris` on Python 3.12
- [ ] **CI capacity**: Can run 2-hour nightly jobs
- [ ] **Resource allocation**: 40-80 hours approved over 5-6 weeks
- [ ] **Team training**: Lead developer completed Atheris tutorial

**Track status**: [fuzzing_coverage_guided_readiness.md](./fuzzing_coverage_guided_readiness.md)

## Phased Timeline

### Phase 2a: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1, 10-15 hours)

**Goal**: Prepare development and CI environment for Atheris

| Task | Hours | Deliverable | Reference |
|------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Set up Atheris dev environment | 2-3 | Python 3.12 + atheris working locally | [fuzzing_coverage_guided.md Phase 2a](./fuzzing_coverage_guided.md) |
| Create harness template | 3-4 | `fuzz/atheris/_template.py` with utilities | [Harness Design](./fuzzing_coverage_guided.md) |
| Configure nightly CI | 3-4 | `.github/workflows/fuzz-atheris-nightly.yml` | [fuzzing_coverage_guided.md Phase 2a](./fuzzing_coverage_guided.md) |
| Set up corpus storage | 2-4 | S3/Artifacts with 90-day retention | [fuzzing_coverage_guided.md Phase 2a](./fuzzing_coverage_guided.md) |

**Decision Point**: Can run 30-min Atheris harness successfully in CI? â†’ Proceed to Phase 2b

---

### Phase 2b: Harness Development (Weeks 2-3, 15-25 hours)

**Goal**: Implement harnesses for top 3 security modules

| Module | Priority | Hours | Deliverable |
|--------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `approved_endpoints.py` | CRITICAL | 6-8 | `fuzz/atheris/fuzz_url_validator.py` + 50 seeds |
| `path_guard.py` | CRITICAL | 6-8 | `fuzz/atheris/fuzz_path_guard.py` + 50 seeds |
| `prompt_renderer.py` | HIGH | 5-7 | `fuzz/atheris/fuzz_template_renderer.py` + 50 seeds |

**Per-Harness Checklist**:
- [ ] Harness achieves >10K executions/second
- [ ] Bug injection test: catches planted vulnerability
- [ ] Seed corpus: 50+ inputs (known attacks + edge cases)
- [ ] Oracle assertions enforce security invariants
- [ ] 30-minute CI run completes successfully

**Decision Point**: All 3 harnesses operational + â‰¥1 new bug found? â†’ Proceed to Phase 2c

---

### Phase 2c: CI Integration & Automation (Week 4, 10-15 hours)

**Goal**: Production-ready nightly fuzzing with automated triage

| Task | Hours | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Nightly 2-hour fuzzing runs | 3-4 | All 3 harnesses run in parallel |
| Automatic crash minimization | 3-4 | Minimized crashes uploaded as artifacts |
| GitHub issue auto-creation | 2-3 | S0/S1 crashes â†’ issues with `[FUZZ-ATHERIS]` label |
| Corpus management automation | 2-4 | Dedupe, minimize, prune corpus weekly |

**Success Metrics**:
- âœ… Nightly runs complete in <2 hours
- âœ… Crashes minimized automatically
- âœ… S0/S1 findings alert within 1 hour
- âœ… Corpus grows by 100+ interesting inputs/week

---

### Phase 2d: Optimization & Hardening (Weeks 5-6, 10-20 hours)

**Goal**: Maximize coverage, integrate sanitizers, establish maintenance

| Task | Hours | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Coverage optimization | 4-6 | â‰¥90% branch coverage on fuzzed modules |
| AddressSanitizer integration | 3-5 | ASan detects memory issues |
| Performance tuning | 2-4 | >15K exec/sec per harness |
| Documentation & runbooks | 3-5 | "Atheris Crash Triage" playbook |

**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… Branch coverage >90% on fuzzed modules (higher than Hypothesis 85%)
- âœ… â‰¥1 unique bug found that Hypothesis missed
- âœ… ASan/MSan integrated in nightly runs
- âœ… Team trained on Atheris crash triage

---

## Critical Success Factors

### Must-Haves (Non-Negotiable)

1. âœ… **Performance**: >10K executions/second per harness (else too slow to find bugs)
2. âœ… **Oracles**: Same security invariants as Hypothesis + crash detection
3. âœ… **Bug injection validation**: Prove Atheris catches planted vulnerabilities (100% detection)
4. âœ… **Unique findings**: Must discover â‰¥1 bug Hypothesis missed (proves complementary value)

### Key Metrics

- **Discovery**: â‰¥1 unique S0-S2 bug per quarter
- **Coverage**: â‰¥90% branch coverage (vs 85% for Hypothesis)
- **Performance**: >10K exec/sec sustained
- **False positives**: <15% (higher tolerance than Hypothesis <10%)
- **Maintenance**: <6 hours/month

## Resource Requirements

**Team**: 1 senior Python developer + security engineer (advisor)
**Time**: 40-80 hours over 5-6 weeks
**Skills**: Python testing, fuzzing concepts (Atheris tutorial), security analysis

**Infrastructure**:
- **CI**: 2 hours/day nightly + 8 hours/week deep fuzzing = ~$50-100/month
- **Storage**: 2-3GB corpus + crash artifacts = ~$5-10/month
- **Tools**: Atheris (free), AddressSanitizer (free)

**Total monthly cost**: ~$50-110/month in cloud resources

---

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation | Tracking |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Atheris Python 3.12 support delayed | Monitor releases monthly; consider alternatives (Pythia) | [Readiness doc](./fuzzing_coverage_guided_readiness.md) |
| Performance <10K exec/sec | Mock I/O, use in-memory filesystem, optimize harness | Week 2-3 checkpoints |
| False positives >20% | Start with permissive oracles, iterate based on findings | Week 4 metrics review |
| No unique bugs found | Extend fuzzing time, improve seed corpus, tune harnesses | Week 5 decision point |

## Notes

- **Python version**: All fuzzing on Python 3.12 (once Atheris supports it)
- **Parallel with Hypothesis**: Both approaches run (Hypothesis PR tests, Atheris nightly)
- **Unique value proposition**: Atheris must find â‰¥1 bug Hypothesis missed to justify investment
- **Maintenance commitment**: <6 hours/month after initial setup
- **Decision points**: Clear go/no-go criteria at end of each phase
