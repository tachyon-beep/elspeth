# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer current but preserved for reference.

## What's Archived Here?

### Development Notes (`dev-notes/`)

Historical development notes from 2024-2025 including:
- Phase planning documents (phase5-7)
- ADRs and architecture decision records
- Refactoring plans and status notes
- Initial assessments and status snapshots

**Note:** These documents reflect the state of planning and development at the time they were written. The current architecture has evolved significantly. Refer to [`../architecture/`](../architecture/) for current documentation.

### Old Requirements (`old-requirements/`)

Legacy requirements documents and historical code from the original implementation:
- Original experiment runner requirements
- Historical experiment stats requirements
- Main application requirements
- Legacy code snapshots (.historical files)

**Note:** These requirements were superseded by the current architecture. See [`../architecture/architecture-overview.md`](../architecture/architecture-overview.md) for the current design.

### Audits (`audits/`)

Historical code quality and security audits:
- Legacy code audit findings

**Note:** For current security audits, see [`../compliance/security-audit-2025.md`](../compliance/security-audit-2025.md).

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

1. **Historical Context:** Understand why certain decisions were made
2. **Traceability:** Track evolution of architecture and design
3. **Reference:** Consult original requirements when needed
4. **Compliance:** Maintain audit trail for governance purposes

## Using Archived Documentation

⚠️ **Warning:** Do not use archived documentation as a reference for current development. Always consult the current documentation in:
- [`../architecture/`](../architecture/) - Current architecture
- [`../development/`](../development/) - Current development practices
- [`../compliance/`](../compliance/) - Current compliance controls
- [`../roadmap/`](../roadmap/) - Current and future work
