## Summary

No integration seam defect found in /home/john/elspeth-rapid/src/elspeth/engine/artifacts.py

## Severity

- Severity: trivial
- Priority: P3

## Anti-Pattern Classification

None identified

- [ ] Parallel Type Evolution (duplicate definitions of same concept)
- [ ] Impedance Mismatch (complex translation at boundaries)
- [ ] Leaky Abstraction (implementation details cross boundaries)
- [ ] Contract Violation (undocumented assumptions)
- [ ] Shared Mutable State (unclear ownership)
- [ ] God Object (excessive coupling through large context)
- [ ] Stringly-Typed Interface (magic strings instead of types)
- [ ] Missing Facade (complex subsystem without simple interface)
- [ ] Protocol Drift (versions incompatible)
- [ ] Callback Hell (complex async chains)
- [ ] Missing Error Translation (low-level errors leak)
- [ ] Implicit State Dependencies (call order matters but not enforced)
