## Refactoring Summary

**Before**: Cognitive complexity 69, 138 lines, monolithic run() method
**After**: Cognitive complexity 8 (88.4% reduction), 55 lines, 11 helper methods

**Result**: Zero behavioral changes, zero regressions, 100% test pass rate

## Implementation Details

**Methodology**: Five-phase complexity reduction (Phase 0 â†’ Phase 4)
**Duration**: ~14 hours over 3 days
**Key Techniques**:
- Comprehensive Phase 0 safety net (35% of time investment)
- Supporting classes (`SuiteContext`, `ExperimentContext`)
- One-at-a-time method extraction with test-after-each
- Template Method pattern for orchestration

**Tests**: All 800+ tests passing throughout, MyPy clean, Ruff clean

## Special Challenges Addressed

1. **Baseline Comparison Timing** - Complex state management for baseline vs variant comparison
2. **Sink Resolution Priority** - Multi-level priority chain (suite â†’ experiment â†’ prompt pack â†’ defaults)
3. **Middleware Lifecycle** - Notification patterns for suite_loaded and suite_complete events
4. **Context Propagation** - Security level, run_id, and audit logger threading through pipeline
