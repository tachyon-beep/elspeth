### Why This Works

1. **Test-First Safety Net:** Characterization tests + mutation testing capture existing behavior BEFORE any changes
2. **Incremental Extraction:** Small, verifiable steps with continuous testing after EACH change
3. **Risk-First Approach:** Address highest-risk areas before refactoring begins (two-stage assessment)
4. **Proven Patterns:** Template Method + Parameter Object + Guard Clauses
5. **Continuous Validation:** MyPy + tests + mutation testing after EVERY change
6. **Non-Functional Parity:** Performance, memory, logging, security verified unchanged
7. **Auditable Process:** ADRs + comprehensive docs create architectural record

### When NOT to Use This Methodology

❌ Don't use this for:

- Functions with complexity < 25 (not worth the effort - use 25 as threshold)
- Untested code with < 50% coverage (build tests first in separate PR)
- Active feature development (>2 PRs/week creates merge conflicts)
- Code scheduled for deletion within 6 months
- Prototypes or experimental code
- **High-churn code** where primary cost is volatility, not complexity
- **Code with undocumented third-party side effects** (do isolation spike first)

---

## When to Use This Methodology

### Ideal Candidates

✅ **Use this methodology when:**

1. **High Cognitive Complexity**
   - SonarQube flags function as "Critical" or "Major"
   - Complexity score ≥ 25 (target: reduce by 85%)
   - Multiple nested conditionals (>3 levels)
   - Function length > 100 lines

2. **Critical Path Code**
   - Core business logic
   - High-traffic execution paths
   - Security-sensitive functions
   - Functions that change frequently

3. **Stable Context**
   - No active feature work on this code
   - Clear ownership and review process
   - Time available for thorough work (10-15 hours)

4. **Good Test Foundation**
   - Existing tests cover ≥70% of function
   - Tests can be run quickly (<5 min)
   - MyPy/linting infrastructure in place

### ROI Calculation & Decision Matrix

**Break-Even Formula:**

```
Time Saved per Future Modification = 0.5 × (Current Modification Time)
Break-Even Point = 13 hours / (Time Saved per Modification)

Example: If function takes 3 hours to modify currently:
Break-Even = 13 / (0.5 × 3) = 8.7 future modifications

If modification frequency < 8.7 changes per year, ROI is marginal - consider deferring.
```

**Two-Stage Risk Assessment (detailed in Phase 0):**

| Criteria | Threshold | Decision |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Complexity | < 25 | Don't refactor |
| Complexity | 25-40 | Standard methodology |
| Complexity | 41-60 | Add mutation testing + non-functional checks |
| Complexity | 61+ | High risk - comprehensive Phase 0 critical |
| Test Coverage | < 50% | Build tests first (separate PR) |
| Test Coverage | 50-69% | Add tests during Phase 0 |
| Test Coverage | ≥ 70% | Proceed with standard methodology |
| Modification Frequency | < 1 change/year | Defer (won't recoup 13h investment) |
| Modification Frequency | 1-6 changes/year | Proceed if high-impact |
| Modification Frequency | > 6 changes/year | High priority |
| Remaining Lifespan | < 6 months | Defer (scheduled deprecation) |
| Active Development | > 2 PRs/week | Defer (merge conflict risk) |

**For frequently-modified code (>6 changes/year), ROI positive in 2-3 months.**

## The Five-Phase Process

### Overview

The methodology follows a strict five-phase sequence. **Each phase must complete successfully before proceeding to the next.**

```
Phase 0: Safety Net Construction (30% of time)
    ↓
Phase 1: Supporting Classes (10% of time)
    ↓
Phase 2: Simple Helper Extractions (20% of time)
    ↓
Phase 3: Complex Method Extractions (30% of time)
    ↓
Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup (10% of time)
```

**Total Time:** 10-15 hours

### Phase Sequence is Critical

⚠️ **DO NOT skip phases or change the order!**

The sequence is designed to:

1. Build confidence before making changes (Phase 0)
2. Create infrastructure for complexity reduction (Phase 1)
3. Start with low-risk extractions (Phase 2)
4. Progress to high-risk extractions when safety net is proven (Phase 3)
5. Ensure maintainability for future developers (Phase 4)

## Phase 0: Safety Net Construction

**Goal:** Create comprehensive test coverage that will detect ANY behavioral change.

**Time Investment:** 35% of total time (4-6 hours)
**Tests Created:** 6+ characterization tests, 20-30 behavioral tests
**Mutation Score Target:** ≤ 10% surviving mutants (90%+ mutation score)
**Success Criteria:** All tests passing, 80%+ coverage, mutation testing validates test strength

### Step 0.1: Read the Code (30 min)

**Goal:** Understand WHAT the function does (not HOW it does it).

1. **Open the target function** in your editor
2. **Read the docstring** (if it exists)
3. **Trace inputs and outputs:**
   - What parameters does it take?
   - What does it return?
   - What side effects does it have?
4. **Identify dependencies:**
   - What external functions does it call?
   - What state does it modify?
5. **List edge cases:**
   - Empty inputs?
   - None/null values?
   - Maximum/minimum boundaries?

**Deliverable:** Markdown notes documenting function behavior.

**Example:**

```markdown
## runner.py::run() Behavior

**Purpose:** Execute experiment with LLM across all rows in DataFrame.

**Inputs:**
- df: pd.DataFrame (input data, can be empty)
- config: Optional dict (may be None)

**Outputs:**
- dict with keys: "results", "failures", "metadata"

**Side Effects:**
- Calls sink.write() for each row
- Modifies cost tracker state
- Logs to logger

**Edge Cases:**
- Empty DataFrame → return empty results
- Missing prompts → raise ConfigurationError
- Rate limit hit → respect limiter, continue after delay
```

### Step 0.2: Identify Risk Areas (30 min - 1 hour)

**Goal:** Find the highest-risk code sections that need extra test coverage.

Use these techniques:

**1. Complexity Hotspots**

```bash
# Use SonarQube or similar
sonar-scanner # Shows complexity breakdown by line
```

Look for:

- Deeply nested conditionals (>3 levels)
- Large loops with complex bodies
- Exception handling with multiple paths
- Shared state management

**2. Change History**

```bash
# Which lines change most frequently?
git log --follow -p --all -- path/to/file.py | grep "^[+-]" | head -100
```

Frequently-changed code has higher bug risk.

**3. Implicit Dependencies**

- Code that relies on call order
- Shared mutable state
- Singleton patterns
- Thread-local storage

**Deliverable:** Risk assessment document with scores.

**Example:**

```markdown
## Risk Assessment: suite_runner.py::run()

| Risk Area | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Middleware deduplication** | 4.0 (HIGHEST) | Uses id() for object tracking, subtle bug potential |
| **Baseline comparison timing** | 1.05 (HIGH) | Must run after baseline completes, order-dependent |
| **Sink resolution priority** | ~1.0 (HIGH) | 5-level hierarchy, easy to break priority |
| **Empty suite handling** | MEDIUM | Edge case, may not be tested |

**Priority:** Address risks in score order during risk reduction activities.
```

### Step 0.3: Risk Reduction Activities (1-3 hours)

**Goal:** Mitigate top 3-5 risks BEFORE starting refactoring.

For each high-risk area, create:

1. **Documentation** - Explain the subtle behavior
2. **Tests** - Verify the behavior works correctly
3. **Examples** - Show how it should be used

**Risk Reduction Checklist:**

For each risk area:

- [ ] Create markdown doc explaining the behavior
- [ ] Write 3-7 tests covering normal + edge cases
- [ ] Verify tests pass with current implementation
- [ ] Add comments to risky code sections

**Example Activities (PR #11):**

1. **Middleware Hook Tracer** (Risk Score 4.0):
   - Created MiddlewareHookTracer test helper
   - Wrote 7 tests for deduplication behavior
   - Verified hooks called in correct order
   - Time: 2 hours

2. **Baseline Flow Diagram** (Risk Score 1.05):
   - Drew ASCII flow diagrams
   - Documented timing guarantees
   - Wrote 9 tests for baseline ordering
   - Time: 30 min

3. **Sink Resolution Docs** (Risk Score ~1.0):
   - Created 5-level priority decision tree
   - Documented with examples
   - Wrote 8 tests (3 passing initially)
   - Time: 1 hour

**Deliverables:**

- Risk reduction markdown docs
- 15-30 new risk-focused tests
- Updated inline comments

### Step 0.4: Write Characterization Tests (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Create integration tests that capture COMPLETE workflows.

Characterization tests verify:

- ✅ Complete input → output transformation
- ✅ All side effects (file writes, logging, state changes)
- ✅ Integration of all components
- ✅ Edge cases and error paths

**Test Template:**

```python
def test_characterization_complete_workflow(self):
    """CHARACTERIZATION: Complete workflow from input to output.

    This test captures the EXISTING behavior of the function. Any change
    to this test during refactoring indicates a behavioral regression.

    Verifies:
    - Input processing
    - Output structure
    - Side effects
    - Edge case handling
    """
    # Setup
    input_data = create_realistic_input()
    expected_side_effects = []

    # Execute
    result = target_function(input_data)

    # Verify complete behavior
    assert result["status"] == "success"
    assert len(result["items"]) == expected_count
    assert mock_sink.calls == expected_side_effects
    assert logger.messages == expected_logs
```

**How Many Tests?**

Minimum: 6 characterization tests covering:

1. Happy path (normal inputs, normal outputs)
2. Empty inputs
3. Maximum inputs (stress test)
4. Error handling
5. Edge case 1
6. Edge case 2

**Example (PR #11 - suite_runner.py):**

```python
# Test 1: Complete result structure
test_run_result_structure_complete_workflow()

# Test 2: Baseline tracking end-to-end
test_baseline_tracking_through_complete_execution()

# Test 3: Sink resolution integration
test_sink_resolution_priority_integration()

# Test 4: Context propagation
test_context_propagation_to_components()

# Test 5: Execution order
test_experiment_execution_order_and_completeness()

# Test 6: Multi-layer config merging
test_complete_workflow_with_defaults_and_packs()
```

### Step 0.5: Verify Safety Net (30 min)

**Goal:** Confirm all tests pass and provide adequate coverage.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Run all new tests: `pytest tests/test_<target>_*.py -v`
- [ ] Verify 100% pass rate
- [ ] Check coverage: `pytest --cov=path/to/target.py`
- [ ] Ensure coverage ≥ 80% on target function
- [ ] Run MyPy: `mypy path/to/target.py`
- [ ] Run linter: `ruff check path/to/target.py`

**If ANY check fails, stop and fix before proceeding to Phase 1.**

### Step 0.6: Mutation Testing (30-60 min)

**New in v1.1** - **Goal:** Verify test suite strength by detecting weak assertions.

Mutation testing introduces small changes ("mutants") to your code and verifies that your tests catch these changes. A "surviving mutant" means your tests didn't detect the bug, indicating weak test coverage.

**Why This Matters:**

- 80% line coverage ≠ 80% bug detection
- Tests may execute code without verifying behavior
- Mutation testing reveals gaps in assertions

**Target:** ≤ 10% surviving mutants (90%+ mutation score)

**Step-by-Step:**

**1. Install mutmut (recommended for most projects):**

```bash
pip install mutmut
```

**2. Run mutation testing on target function:**

```bash
mutmut run --paths-to-mutate src/<path>/target.py
```

This will:
- Generate mutants (changes like `==` → `!=`, `True` → `False`)
- Run your test suite against each mutant
- Report survivors (mutants that didn't break tests)

**3. Check results:**

```bash
mutmut results
mutmut show  # Shows each surviving mutant
```

**Example Output:**

```
⚡ Creating mutants... Done
🧬 Running mutants... 150 mutants
✅ Killed: 135 (90%)
❌ Survived: 15 (10%)
⏭️  Skipped: 0
```

**4. Interpret results:**

| Mutation Score | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| ≥ 90% (≤ 10% survivors) | ✅ Proceed to Phase 1 |
| 80-89% (11-20% survivors) | Add 2-3 more tests, re-run |
| < 80% (> 20% survivors) | Significant gaps - add 5-10 tests |

**5. Address surviving mutants:**

```bash
mutmut show 42  # Show details of mutant #42
```

For each survivor, ask:
- Is this mutant equivalent? (No behavioral change)
- Is my test missing an assertion?
- Should I add a test for this case?

**Example Survivor Analysis:**

```python
# Original code:
if experiment.is_baseline:
    baseline_payload = payload

# Mutant (survived):
if experiment.is_baseline:
    baseline_payload = None  # Changed payload → None

# Why it survived: No test verified baseline_payload contents!
# Fix: Add assertion
assert ctx.baseline_payload == expected_payload
```

**Common Equivalent Mutants (can ignore):**

- Cosmetic string changes in log messages
- Debug-only code paths
- Unreachable defensive code

**Alternative Tool: cosmic-ray (for large codebases)**

If mutmut is too slow (>10 min runtime):

```bash
pip install cosmic-ray
cosmic-ray init config.toml src/<path>/target.py -- pytest tests/
cosmic-ray exec config.toml
cosmic-ray report config.toml
```

**Benefits:** Parallel execution, more mutation operators
**Drawback:** More complex configuration

**Deliverable:**

- Mutation testing report showing ≤ 10% survivors
- Additional tests added to kill high-value mutants

**⚠️ Budget Alert:** If mutation testing reveals < 80% score, you may need to add 1-2 hours to Phase 0 budget. This is GOOD - better to find gaps now than during refactoring!

### Step 0.7: Commit Safety Net (15 min)

**Goal:** Create a clean commit with all test infrastructure.

```bash
git add tests/test_*.py tests/conftest.py docs/*.md
git commit -m "Phase 0: Characterization tests safety net (<target> refactoring)

Created comprehensive test coverage for <target> refactoring:
- 6 characterization tests (integration workflows)
- 28 behavioral tests (risk mitigation)
- 100% pass rate, 85% coverage
- Mutation score: X% (≤ 10% survivors)

Risk reduction activities completed:
- Activity 1: <High risk area> (7 tests)
- Activity 2: <Medium risk area> (8 tests)
- Activity 3: <Edge cases> (6 tests)

Mutation testing validated test strength:
- X mutants killed, Y survived
- High-value survivors addressed with additional assertions

Safety net construction complete. Ready for Phase 1.

## Phase 1: Supporting Classes

**Goal:** Create dataclasses to consolidate scattered state and reduce parameter passing.

**Time Investment:** 10% of total time (1-1.5 hours)
**Classes Created:** 1-3 dataclasses
**Success Criteria:** All existing tests still passing, clean MyPy

### Step 1.1: Identify State Clusters (15 min)

**Goal:** Find groups of related variables that should be together.

Look for:

1. **Scattered local variables** - 5+ variables initialized at start of function
2. **Parameter clumps** - Same 3-4 parameters passed to multiple helpers
3. **Related state** - Variables that are always used together

**Example (suite_runner.py):**

```python
# BEFORE: 8 scattered local variables
def run(self, df, defaults=None, sink_factory=None, preflight_info=None):
    defaults = defaults or {}
    prompt_packs = defaults.get("prompt_packs", {})
    experiments = []  # Built from suite
    baseline_payload = None
    results = {}
    preflight_info = preflight_info or {}
    notified_middlewares = set()
    # ... 130 more lines
```

**State Clusters Identified:**

1. **Suite Execution State:** defaults, prompt_packs, experiments, baseline_payload, results, preflight_info, notified_middlewares
2. **Experiment Execution Config:** experiment, pack, sinks, runner, context, middlewares

### Step 1.2: Design Dataclasses (30 min)

**Goal:** Create typed dataclasses for each state cluster.

**Template:**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Any

@dataclass
class <Name>Context:
    """<One-line description>.

    This dataclass consolidates <N> scattered variables into a cohesive
    state object. It reduces parameter passing and makes state management
    explicit.

    Attributes:
        field1: <Description>
        field2: <Description>
        ...
    """
    field1: Type
    field2: Type | None = None
    field3: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, <params>) -> <Name>Context:
        """Factory method to create context from inputs.

        Args:
            param1: <Description>

        Returns:
            Initialized context ready for execution
        """
        # Initialization logic
        return cls(field1=value1, field2=value2, ...)
```

**Example (suite_runner.py):**

```python
@dataclass
class SuiteExecutionContext:
    """Encapsulates suite-level execution state during run()."""
    defaults: dict[str, Any]
    prompt_packs: dict[str, Any]
    experiments: list[ExperimentConfig]
    suite_metadata: list[dict[str, Any]]
    baseline_payload: dict[str, Any] | None = None
    results: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
    preflight_info: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
    notified_middlewares: dict[int, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, suite, defaults, preflight_info=None):
        # Build experiments with baseline first
        experiments = []
        if suite.baseline:
            experiments.append(suite.baseline)
        experiments.extend(exp for exp in suite.experiments if exp != suite.baseline)

        return cls(
            defaults=defaults,
            prompt_packs=defaults.get("prompt_packs", {}),
            experiments=experiments,
            suite_metadata=[...],
            preflight_info=preflight_info or {},
        )
```

**Dataclass Design Principles:**

1. **Single Responsibility:** Each dataclass manages one cohesive concept
2. **Immutability First (New in v1.1):** **Default to `frozen=True` unless mutation is required**
   - Immutable dataclasses prevent accidental state modification
   - Thread-safe by default
   - Easier to reason about in complex logic
   - Only make mutable if you need to update fields during execution
3. **Type Safety:** Annotate ALL fields with types (including Optional, Union, etc.)
4. **Factory Methods:** Provide `create()` classmethod for complex initialization
5. **Documentation:** Comprehensive docstrings explaining purpose and field relationships

**Immutability Guidance:**

**Use `frozen=True` when:**
- State is configuration data that shouldn't change
- Object is created once and read many times
- You want to prevent accidental mutation bugs

**Example (Preferred - Immutable):**

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)  # ✅ Immutable by default
class BaselineComparisonConfig:
    """Configuration for baseline comparison execution (immutable)."""
    experiment: ExperimentConfig
    current_payload: dict[str, Any]
    pack: dict[str, Any] | None
    defaults: dict[str, Any]
```

**Use mutable dataclass when:**
- You need to accumulate results during execution
- State changes incrementally (e.g., result tracking)

**Example (Mutable - Only When Needed):**

```python
@dataclass  # Mutable - results accumulate during execution
class SuiteExecutionContext:
    """Execution state that changes during suite run."""
    defaults: dict[str, Any]
    experiments: list[ExperimentConfig]
    baseline_payload: dict[str, Any] | None = None
    results: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)  # Mutates!

    def add_result(self, exp_id: str, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        """Accumulate result during execution."""
        self.results[exp_id] = payload  # Requires mutability
```

**⚠️ Design Tip:** If unsure, start with `frozen=True`. It's easier to remove immutability later than to track down mutation bugs.

### Step 1.3: Add Unit Tests (15-30 min)

**Goal:** Verify dataclass initialization and factory methods.

```python
def test_suite_execution_context_creation():
    """Test SuiteExecutionContext.create() factory method."""
    suite = ExperimentSuite(...)
    defaults = {"prompt_system": "Test"}

    ctx = SuiteExecutionContext.create(suite, defaults)

    assert ctx.defaults == defaults
    assert len(ctx.experiments) == 3
    assert ctx.experiments[0].is_baseline  # Baseline first
    assert ctx.baseline_payload is None
    assert ctx.results == {}
```

**Test checklist:**

- [ ] Test factory method with normal inputs
- [ ] Test with empty/minimal inputs
- [ ] Test with maximum inputs
- [ ] Verify baseline-first ordering (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify default values set correctly

### Step 1.4: Integrate into Target Function (15-30 min)

**Goal:** Replace scattered variables with dataclass instance.

**Before:**

```python
def run(self, df, defaults=None):
    defaults = defaults or {}
    results = {}
    baseline_payload = None
    # ... use results, baseline_payload throughout
```

**After:**

```python
def run(self, df, defaults=None):
    defaults = defaults or {}
    ctx = SuiteExecutionContext.create(self.suite, defaults)
    # ... use ctx.results, ctx.baseline_payload throughout
```

**Integration checklist:**

- [ ] Replace variable declarations with ctx creation
- [ ] Update all variable references to ctx.field
- [ ] Run tests: ALL should still pass
- [ ] Run MyPy: should be clean
- [ ] No behavioral changes

### Step 1.5: Commit Phase 1 (15 min)

```bash
git add src/<path>/target.py tests/test_*.py
git commit -m "Phase 1: Supporting dataclasses for <target> refactoring

Created dataclasses to consolidate scattered state:
- SuiteExecutionContext: 8 suite-level variables → single object
- ExperimentExecutionConfig: 6 experiment config fields → single object

Benefits:
- Reduced parameter passing complexity
- Type-safe attribute access
- Explicit state management
- Foundation for helper method extractions

All 34 tests still passing. No behavioral changes.

## Phase 2: Simple Helper Extractions

**Goal:** Extract low-risk, clearly-defined helper methods.

**Time Investment:** 20% of total time (2-3 hours)
**Methods Extracted:** 4-6 simple helpers
**Success Criteria:** All tests passing, complexity reduced by ~30-40%

### Step 2.1: Identify Simple Extraction Candidates (30 min)

**Goal:** Find code blocks that can be extracted with ZERO risk.

**What Makes a "Simple" Extraction?**

✅ **Extract if:**

- Self-contained logic (no complex state dependencies)
- Clear inputs and outputs
- No side effects (or minimal, well-defined side effects)
- 5-20 lines long
- Used only once (but could be reused in future)

❌ **Don't extract yet if:**

- Depends on multiple pieces of mutable state
- Has complex error handling
- Interleaved with other logic
- Modifies many external variables

**Examples of Simple Extractions:**

1. **Initialization blocks:**

```python
# EXTRACT THIS
def _prepare_suite_context(self, defaults, preflight_info):
    """Initialize suite execution context."""
    return SuiteExecutionContext.create(self.suite, defaults, preflight_info)
```

2. **Priority chain lookups:**

```python
# EXTRACT THIS
def _resolve_experiment_sinks(self, experiment, pack, defaults, sink_factory):
    """Resolve sinks using 5-level priority chain."""
    if experiment.sink_defs:
        return self._instantiate_sinks(experiment.sink_defs)
    if pack and pack.get("sinks"):
        return self._instantiate_sinks(pack["sinks"])
    # ... etc
```

3. **Simple getters:**

```python
# EXTRACT THIS
def _get_experiment_context(self, runner, experiment, defaults):
    """Retrieve PluginContext from runner or create fallback."""
    return getattr(runner, "plugin_context", PluginContext(...))
```

4. **Cleanup blocks:**

```python
# EXTRACT THIS
def _finalize_suite(self, ctx):
    """Notify middlewares that suite execution is complete."""
    for mw in ctx.notified_middlewares.values():
        if hasattr(mw, "on_suite_complete"):
            mw.on_suite_complete()
```

### Step 2.2: Extract First Simple Helper (15-30 min)

**Goal:** Extract ONE helper method, verify tests pass.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Choose the simplest candidate** from your list
2. **Copy the code block** to a new method
3. **Add comprehensive docstring**
4. **Add type hints** for all parameters and return value
5. **Replace original code** with method call
6. **Run tests immediately**

**Template:**

```python
def _<verb>_<noun>(self, param1: Type1, param2: Type2) -> ReturnType:
    """<One-line description in imperative mood>.

    <2-3 sentences explaining what this method does, why it exists,
    and any important behavior details.>

    Args:
        param1: <Description>
        param2: <Description>

    Returns:
        <Description of return value>

    Complexity Reduction:
        Before: <X> lines inline in run()
        After: Single method call
    """
    # Implementation
    return result
```

**Example:**

```python
def _prepare_suite_context(
    self,
    defaults: dict[str, Any],
    preflight_info: dict[str, Any] | None,
) -> SuiteExecutionContext:
    """Initialize suite execution context with all state tracking.

    This method consolidates the initialization logic that was previously
    scattered at the beginning of run(). It creates a SuiteExecutionContext
    with proper experiment ordering (baseline-first), suite metadata for
    middleware notifications, and preflight information.

    Args:
        defaults: Default configuration values for the suite
        preflight_info: Optional metadata about run environment

    Returns:
        Initialized SuiteExecutionContext ready for experiment execution

    Complexity Reduction:
        Before: ~8 lines of initialization logic in run()
        After: Single factory method call
    """
    return SuiteExecutionContext.create(self.suite, defaults, preflight_info)
```

**Before:**

```python
def run(self, df, defaults=None, preflight_info=None):
    defaults = defaults or {}
    ctx = SuiteExecutionContext.create(self.suite, defaults, preflight_info)
    # ... rest of method
```

**After:**

```python
def run(self, df, defaults=None, preflight_info=None):
    defaults = defaults or {}
    ctx = self._prepare_suite_context(defaults, preflight_info)
    # ... rest of method
```

**Verify:**

```bash
pytest tests/test_<target>*.py -v  # ALL must pass
mypy src/<path>/target.py          # Must be clean
```

**⚠️ If tests fail, REVERT and investigate before proceeding!**

### Step 2.3: Extract Remaining Simple Helpers (1-2 hours)

**Goal:** Extract 3-5 more simple helpers, ONE AT A TIME.

**Process for each helper:**

1. Extract method
2. Run tests immediately
3. Fix any issues
4. Commit (optional: can batch 2-3 simple extractions)

**Example Sequence (PR #11):**

**Extraction 1:** `_prepare_suite_context()`

- Lines: 8 → 1
- Risk: VERY LOW
- Tests: ✅ All pass

**Extraction 2:** `_resolve_experiment_sinks()`

- Lines: 15 → 1
- Risk: LOW (priority chain logic)
- Tests: ✅ All pass

**Extraction 3:** `_get_experiment_context()`

- Lines: 14 → 1
- Risk: VERY LOW (simple getter)
- Tests: ✅ All pass

**Extraction 4:** `_finalize_suite()`

- Lines: 5 → 1
- Risk: VERY LOW (cleanup)
- Tests: ✅ All pass

**Metrics After Simple Extractions:**

- Original lines: 138
- After Phase 2: ~90-100 lines (30-35% reduction)
- Original complexity: 69
- After Phase 2: ~45-50 (30-35% reduction)

### Step 2.4: Commit Phase 2 (15 min)

```bash
git add src/<path>/target.py
git commit -m "Phase 2: Simple helper method extractions from <target>

Extracted 4 low-risk helper methods:
- _prepare_suite_context(): Suite initialization (8 → 1 lines)
- _resolve_experiment_sinks(): 5-level priority chain (15 → 1 lines)
- _get_experiment_context(): PluginContext retrieval (14 → 1 lines)
- _finalize_suite(): Middleware cleanup (5 → 1 lines)

Impact:
- Lines: 138 → 92 (33% reduction)
- Complexity: 69 → ~50 (27% reduction)
- All 34 tests passing
- No behavioral changes

Next: Phase 3 (Complex method extractions)

## Phase 3: Complex Method Extractions

**Goal:** Extract high-risk orchestration methods that reduce complexity dramatically.

**Time Investment:** 30% of total time (3-4 hours)
**Methods Extracted:** 5-7 complex helpers
**Success Criteria:** Complexity reduced by 80-90%, all tests passing

### Step 3.1: Identify Complex Extraction Candidates (30 min)

**Goal:** Find the high-complexity code blocks that drive up cognitive load.

**What Makes an Extraction "Complex"?**

Complex extractions have:

- Multiple nested conditionals
- Loop + conditional combinations
- Error handling with multiple paths
- State mutations
- Middleware/callback orchestration
- Order-dependent logic

**How to Find Them:**

1. **Use SonarQube hotspots** - Look for blocks with complexity > 10
2. **Look for nested blocks** - 3+ levels of indentation
3. **Find repeated patterns** - Similar logic used multiple times
4. **Identify orchestration** - Code that coordinates multiple components

**Example High-Complexity Areas (suite_runner.py):**

1. **Middleware Suite Loaded Notification** (Complexity ~8):

```python
# 15 lines with nested conditionals + set management
for mw in middlewares:
    key = id(mw)
    if hasattr(mw, "on_suite_loaded") and key not in notified_middlewares:
        mw.on_suite_loaded(metadata, preflight_info)
        notified_middlewares[key] = mw
```

2. **Baseline Comparison Orchestration** (Complexity ~18):

```python
# 25+ lines with multiple guards, plugin merging, execution, notification
if baseline_payload and experiment != self.suite.baseline:
    comp_defs = list(defaults.get("baseline_plugin_defs", []))
    if pack and pack.get("baseline_plugins"):
        comp_defs = list(pack.get("baseline_plugins", [])) + comp_defs
    if experiment.baseline_plugin_defs:
        comp_defs += experiment.baseline_plugin_defs
    if comp_defs:
        comparisons = {}
        for defn in comp_defs:
            plugin = create_baseline_plugin(defn, ...)
            diff = plugin.compare(baseline_payload, payload)
            if diff:
                comparisons[plugin.name] = diff
        if comparisons:
            payload["baseline_comparison"] = comparisons
            for mw in middlewares:
                if hasattr(mw, "on_baseline_comparison"):
                    mw.on_baseline_comparison(experiment.name, comparisons)
```

### Step 3.2: Plan Extraction Strategy (15-30 min)

**Goal:** Decide extraction order and method signatures.

**Principles:**

1. **Extract innermost logic first** - Start with deeply nested blocks
2. **Extract repeated patterns** - DRY up similar code
3. **Extract by responsibility** - One clear job per method
4. **Keep orchestration in run()** - Don't hide the main flow

**Extraction Order for Complex Methods:**

1. Start with **notification/callback patterns** (repeated, high risk)
2. Then **conditional orchestration** (multiple paths)
3. Then **collection/aggregation** (loop + accumulator)
4. Finally **decision trees** (nested conditionals)

**Method Naming Convention:**

- `_notify_*`: For callback/hook patterns
- `_run_*`: For orchestration/execution
- `_merge_*`: For configuration combination
- `_build_*`: For object construction
- `_collect_*`: For aggregation

### Step 3.3: Extract Complex Helpers ONE AT A TIME (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Extract 5-7 complex methods, verifying tests after EACH extraction.

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Extract ONE method, run tests, commit. Repeat.**

**Process:**

```bash
# For EACH complex method extraction:
1. Choose next method from plan
2. Extract method with full docstring
3. Update run() to call new method
4. Run tests: pytest tests/test_*_*.py -v
5. Run MyPy: mypy src/<path>/target.py
6. If tests pass: commit
7. If tests fail: REVERT and investigate
8. Repeat
```

**Example Extraction Sequence (PR #11):**

### Extraction 1: Middleware Suite Loaded

**Before:**

```python
# In run() method (15 lines)
for mw in middlewares:
    key = id(mw)
    if hasattr(mw, "on_suite_loaded") and key not in ctx.notified_middlewares:
        mw.on_suite_loaded(ctx.suite_metadata, ctx.preflight_info)
        ctx.notified_middlewares[key] = mw
```

**After:**

```python
# In run() method (1 line)
self._notify_middleware_suite_loaded(middlewares, ctx)

# New method (10 lines with docstring)
def _notify_middleware_suite_loaded(
    self,

    Args:
        middlewares: List of middleware instances for current experiment
        ctx: Suite execution context with notified_middlewares tracking

    Complexity Reduction:

    }

    for mw in middlewares:
        if hasattr(mw, "on_experiment_start"):
            mw.on_experiment_start(experiment.name, event_metadata)
```

**Tests:** ✅ All 34 passing
**Complexity Saved:** ~5 points

**Tests:** ✅ All 34 passing

### Phase 3 Metrics

**After extracting 5 complex methods:**

- Lines: 92 → 55 (60% total reduction)
- Complexity: ~50 → 8 (88% total reduction!)
- Methods extracted: 4 (Phase 2) + 5 (Phase 3) = 9 total

### Step 3.4: Verify run() is Now Simple (15 min)

**Goal:** Confirm run() is now a readable orchestration template.

The refactored run() should look like this:

```python
def run(self, df, defaults=None, sink_factory=None, preflight_info=None):
    """Execute all experiments using orchestration pattern."""
    defaults = defaults or {}
    ctx = self._prepare_suite_context(defaults, preflight_info)

    for experiment in ctx.experiments:
        pack_name = experiment.prompt_pack or defaults.get("prompt_pack")
        pack = ctx.prompt_packs.get(pack_name) if pack_name else None

        sinks = self._resolve_experiment_sinks(experiment, pack, defaults, sink_factory)
        runner = self.build_runner(experiment, {...}, sinks)
        experiment_context = self._get_experiment_context(runner, experiment, defaults)
        middlewares = cast(list[Any], runner.llm_middlewares or [])

        self._notify_middleware_suite_loaded(middlewares, ctx)
        self._notify_middleware_experiment_start(middlewares, experiment)

        payload = runner.run(df)

        if ctx.baseline_payload is None and (experiment.is_baseline or ...):
            ctx.baseline_payload = payload

        ctx.results[experiment.name] = {"payload": payload, "config": experiment}
        self._notify_middleware_experiment_complete(middlewares, experiment, payload)

        self._run_baseline_comparison(
            experiment, ctx, payload, pack, defaults, middlewares, experiment_context
        )

    self._finalize_suite(ctx)
    return ctx.results
```

**Characteristics of good orchestration template:**

- ✅ Reads like a high-level task list
- ✅ Each line is a clear operation
- ✅ Minimal conditionals (only essential guards)
- ✅ No nested blocks > 2 levels
- ✅ ~30-60 lines total

### Step 3.5: Commit Phase 3 (15 min)

```bash
git add src/<path>/target.py
git commit -m "Phase 3: Complex method extractions from <target>

Extracted 5 high-complexity orchestration methods:
- _notify_middleware_suite_loaded(): Deduplication logic (complexity -8)
- _notify_middleware_experiment_start(): Lifecycle hook (complexity -5)
- _notify_middleware_experiment_complete(): Lifecycle hook (complexity -5)
- _merge_baseline_plugin_defs(): 3-level merge hierarchy (complexity -6)
- _run_baseline_comparison(): Full comparison orchestration (complexity -18)

Impact:
- Lines: 92 → 55 (60% total reduction from original 138)
- Complexity: ~50 → 8 (88% reduction from original 69!)
- All 34 tests passing
- run() method now a clear orchestration template

Target exceeded: 88.4% reduction vs 85% goal

## Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup

**Goal:** Ensure future maintainability through comprehensive documentation.

**Time Investment:** 10% of total time (1-1.5 hours)
**Deliverables:** Enhanced docstrings, summary doc, cleanup verification
**Success Criteria:** Complete documentation, all final checks passing

### Step 4.1: Enhance run() Docstring (30 min)

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive docstring that serves as the method's manual.

**Template:**

**Example (PR #11 - suite_runner.py::run()):**

```python
def run(
    self,
    df: pd.DataFrame,
    defaults: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
    sink_factory: Callable[[ExperimentConfig], list[ResultSink]] | None = None,
    preflight_info: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Execute all experiments in the suite using orchestration pattern.

    This method serves as the orchestration template for suite execution,
    delegating specific responsibilities to focused helper methods. It follows
    the Template Method design pattern to maintain a clear, readable execution
    flow while keeping cognitive complexity low.

    Execution Flow:
        1. Initialize suite context (baseline-first ordering, metadata)
        2. For each experiment:
           a. Resolve configuration (pack, sinks)
           b. Build experiment runner
           c. Notify middlewares (suite_loaded, experiment_start)
           d. Execute experiment
           e. Capture baseline payload (if first baseline)
           f. Store results
           g. Notify middlewares (experiment_complete)
           h. Run baseline comparison (if applicable)
        3. Finalize suite (notify middlewares of completion)
        4. Return aggregated results

    Middleware Lifecycle:
        - on_suite_loaded: Called once per unique middleware (deduplicated)
        - on_experiment_start: Called before each experiment execution
        - on_experiment_complete: Called after each experiment execution
        - on_baseline_comparison: Called when comparison results available
        - on_suite_complete: Called once at suite completion

    Baseline Tracking:
        - First experiment with is_baseline=True is captured as baseline
        - Baseline always executed first (regardless of list order)
        - All non-baseline experiments compared against baseline
        - Comparison uses 3-level plugin merge: defaults → pack → experiment

    Args:
        df: Input DataFrame containing prompts and data for experiments.
            Each row represents one prompt to be processed.
        defaults: Default configuration values for the suite. Can include:
            - prompt_packs: Dict of named prompt pack configurations
            - prompt_pack: Default pack name to use
            - sink_defs: Default sink definitions (5-level priority chain)
            - baseline_plugin_defs: Default baseline comparison plugins
            - security_level: Default security level
        sink_factory: Optional callback factory for creating experiment-specific
            sinks. Called with experiment config when no sinks found in
            experiment/pack/defaults. Signature: (ExperimentConfig) -> list[ResultSink]
        preflight_info: Optional metadata about the run environment. If None,
            auto-generated with experiment_count and baseline name.

    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping experiment names to their results:
        {
            "experiment_name": {
                "payload": dict,  # Results from experiment.run()
                "config": ExperimentConfig,  # Experiment configuration
                "baseline_comparison": dict | None,  # Comparison results (if non-baseline)
            },
            ...
        }

    Raises:
        ConfigurationError: If required configuration is missing or invalid
        ValidationError: If experiment configuration fails validation

    Complexity:
        Cognitive Complexity: 8 (down from 69, 88.4% reduction)
        Lines: 55 (down from 138, 60.1% reduction)
        Helper Methods: 9 specialized methods handle specific responsibilities

    Example:

### Step 4.2: Review Helper Method Docstrings (15 min)

**Goal:** Ensure all extracted helpers have adequate documentation.

**Checklist for each helper method:**

- [ ] One-line summary in imperative mood
- [ ] 1-3 paragraph explanation
- [ ] Args section with type hints
- [ ] Returns section
- [ ] Complexity Reduction note (before/after)
- [ ] See Also section if applicable

**If any helper is missing documentation, add it now.**

### Step 4.3: Check for TODOs and Cleanup (15 min)

**Goal:** Remove any temporary markers and polish the code.

```bash
# Search for TODO comments
grep -r "TODO" src/<path>/target.py

# Search for FIXME comments
grep -r "FIXME" src/<path>/target.py

# Search for temporary debug code
grep -r "print(" src/<path>/target.py
grep -r "import pdb" src/<path>/target.py
```

**Remove or address any findings.**

### Step 4.4: Create Refactoring Summary Document (30 min)

**Goal:** Create a single document summarizing the entire refactoring.

**File:** `REFACTORING_COMPLETE_<target>.md`

**Template:** See [Tools & Templates](#tools--templates) section below.

**Key sections:**

1. Executive Summary (metrics table)
2. Phase-by-phase breakdown
3. Helper methods created
4. Design patterns applied
5. Testing strategy
6. Verification results
7. Review focus areas

### Step 4.5: Final Verification (15 min)

**Goal:** Run all checks one final time before marking complete.

**Checklist:**

```bash
# 1. All tests pass
pytest tests/test_<target>*.py -v
# Expected: 100% pass rate

# 2. Full test suite passes (no regressions in other code)
pytest tests/ -v
# Expected: No new failures

# 3. MyPy clean
mypy src/<path>/target.py
# Expected: Success: no issues found

# 4. Linter clean
ruff check src/<path>/target.py
# Expected: All checks passed!

# 5. Complexity verified
# Use SonarQube or radon
radon cc src/<path>/target.py -s
# Expected: Complexity ≤ 15

# 6. Coverage maintained or improved
pytest --cov=src/<path>/target.py tests/test_<target>*.py
# Expected: Coverage ≥ baseline
```

**⚠️ If ANY check fails, fix before committing Phase 4!**

### Step 4.6: Commit Phase 4 (15 min)

```bash
git add src/<path>/target.py REFACTORING_COMPLETE_<target>.md
git commit -m "Phase 4: Documentation and final cleanup for <target>

Enhanced run() method with comprehensive 85-line docstring including:
- Template Method pattern explanation
- 10-step execution flow

## Risk Reduction Activities

**(Performed BEFORE Phase 0)**

Risk reduction activities are proactive measures to understand and mitigate the highest-risk aspects of the code BEFORE starting the refactoring. These activities significantly reduce the chance of introducing bugs.

### Activity Types

1. **Behavioral Documentation** - Write down how subtle/complex behavior works
2. **Flow Diagrams** - Visual representation of execution paths
3. **Test Infrastructure** - Build helpers to verify tricky behavior
4. **Edge Case Catalog** - Enumerate and test all edge cases

### When to Perform Risk Reduction

Perform risk reduction when:

- Function has complexity ≥ 40 (HIGH complexity)
- Function has known bugs or historical issues
- Function has subtle timing/ordering dependencies
- Function manages shared mutable state
- Function coordinates multiple components

### Risk Scoring Formula

For each risky area, calculate:

```
Risk Score = Impact × Probability × Subtlety

Where:
- Impact: 1-5 (1=minor bug, 5=critical failure)
- Probability: 0.1-1.0 (0.1=rare, 1.0=certain)
- Subtlety: 0.5-2.0 (0.5=obvious, 2.0=hidden)

Examples:
- Middleware deduplication: 5 × 0.8 × 1.0 = 4.0 (HIGHEST)
- Baseline timing: 3 × 0.7 × 0.5 = 1.05 (HIGH)
- Empty list check: 2 × 0.5 × 1.0 = 1.0 (HIGH)
```

### Example Activities (PR #11)

**Activity 1: Middleware Hook Tracer**

- **Risk Score:** 4.0 (HIGHEST)
- **Concern:** Middleware deduplication uses id(), could call hooks multiple times
- **Mitigation:**
  - Created MiddlewareHookTracer test helper
  - Wrote 7 tests for hook sequencing and deduplication
  - Verified shared middleware called once
  - Verified hook arguments passed correctly
- **Time:** 2 hours
- **Value:** Prevented subtle double-notification bug

**Activity 2: Sink Resolution Documentation**

- **Risk Score:** ~1.0 (HIGH)
- **Concern:** 5-level priority chain easy to break
- **Mitigation:**
  - Created 557-line documentation with decision trees
  - Wrote 8 tests for priority ordering (3 initially passing)
  - Documented each fallback level with examples
- **Time:** 1 hour
- **Value:** Caught missing plugin registration (discovered in this PR review!)

**Activity 3: Baseline Flow Diagram**

- **Risk Score:** 1.05 (HIGH)
- **Concern:** Baseline must run first, comparisons only after baseline completes
- **Mitigation:**
  - Drew ASCII flow diagrams showing execution order
  - Documented timing invariants
  - Wrote 9 tests for baseline ordering and comparison timing
- **Time:** 30 min
- **Value:** Ensured baseline-first guarantee preserved

**Activity 5: Edge Case Catalog**

- **Risk Score:** MEDIUM
- **Concern:** Edge cases may break during refactoring
- **Mitigation:**
  - Cataloged 8 edge cases
  - Wrote 6 tests (EC4/EC7 covered in Activity 1)
  - Documented expected behavior for each
- **Time:** 1 hour
- **Value:** Prevented empty suite regression

### Risk Reduction Output Artifacts

For each activity, create:

- **Markdown document** (`<topic>_documentation.md` or `<topic>_flow_diagram.md`)
- **Test file** (`test_<target>_<topic>.py`)
- **Test helpers** (in `conftest.py` if reusable)

These artifacts become part of the codebase's permanent documentation and test suite.

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Skipping or Rushing Phase 0

**Problem:** Developers eager to "start refactoring" skip comprehensive test creation.

**Consequence:** Behavioral changes sneak in, bugs are introduced, rollback required.

**Solution:**

- Spend 30-40% of time on Phase 0
- Don't proceed until ALL tests passing
- Resist temptation to "start the real work"

**Warning Signs:**

- Test coverage < 80%
- Fewer than 6 characterization tests
- Tests don't verify side effects
- "We'll add tests later"

### Pitfall 2: Extracting Multiple Complex Methods at Once

**Problem:** Developer extracts 3-4 complex methods before running tests.

**Consequence:** Tests fail, unclear which extraction broke things, difficult to debug.

**Solution:**

- Extract ONE method at a time
- Run tests IMMEDIATELY after each extraction
- Commit or revert based on test results
- Never batch complex extractions

**Warning Signs:**

- "Let me just extract these related methods together"
- Tests haven't been run in 30+ minutes
- Multiple file edits without commits
- "I'll run tests after I'm done"

### Pitfall 3: Changing Behavior During Refactoring

**Problem:** Developer sees "opportunity to improve" logic while refactoring.

**Consequence:** Refactoring PR becomes feature change, scope creep, delayed merge.

**Solution:**

- Refactoring PRs change structure ONLY, not behavior
- Note improvement opportunities in TODOs for future PRs
- Separate behavior changes from refactoring changes
- If tempted to change behavior, stop and create separate issue

**Warning Signs:**

- "While I'm here, I should fix..."
- "This logic doesn't make sense, let me change it"
- Tests need updating to pass
- PR description includes "also fixed..."

### Pitfall 4: Inadequate Helper Method Documentation

**Problem:** Helper methods extracted without comprehensive docstrings.

**Consequence:** Future developers don't understand why method exists or how to use it.

**Solution:**

- Every helper gets full docstring DURING extraction
- Include: purpose, args, returns, complexity reduction note
- Document WHY the extraction was made
- Add "See Also" references to related methods/docs

**Warning Signs:**

- Helper methods with only one-line docstrings
- Missing Args/Returns sections
- No explanation of method purpose
- "I'll document these later"

### Pitfall 5: Extracting Too Little (Micro-Methods)

**Problem:** Developer extracts 1-2 line methods for everything.

**Consequence:** Code becomes harder to read (too many indirections), no real complexity reduction.

**Solution:**

- Extract 5-20 line blocks in Phase 2
- Extract 15-40 line blocks in Phase 3
- Each method should have a clear, substantial responsibility
- Avoid extracting for extraction's sake

**Warning Signs:**

- Helper methods with 1-3 lines
- Method names longer than method bodies
- Need to jump through 5+ methods to understand flow
- Complexity doesn't meaningfully decrease

### Pitfall 6: Extracting Too Much (God Method to God Class)

**Problem:** Developer moves complexity from one function to one massive helper.

**Consequence:** Complexity not actually reduced, just relocated.

**Solution:**

- Each helper should have complexity ≤ 10
- If helper has complexity > 15, break it down further
- run() should delegate to 8-15 focused helpers, not 2-3 large ones
- Use complexity tools to verify reduction

**Warning Signs:**

- Extracted helper has complexity > 15
- One helper contains 50+ lines
- run() only calls 2-3 methods
- Most complexity moved to one helper

### Pitfall 7: Inadequate Testing Between Extractions

**Problem:** Developer runs limited tests or skips MyPy between extractions.

**Consequence:** Type errors accumulate, integration issues missed until late in process.

**Solution:**

- Run full test suite after EVERY extraction: `pytest tests/test_<target>*.py -v`
- Run MyPy after EVERY extraction: `mypy src/<path>/target.py`
- Run Ruff after EVERY extraction: `ruff check src/<path>/target.py`
- 100% pass rate required to proceed

**Warning Signs:**

- Only running unit tests, not integration tests
- Skipping MyPy checks
- "I'll run full tests later"
- Accumulating type errors

### Pitfall 8: Poor Commit Hygiene

**Problem:** Large batch commits like "refactored everything" or no commits until end.

**Consequence:** Difficult to review, hard to bisect bugs, unclear history.

**Solution:**

- Commit after EACH phase (minimum 5 commits)
- Optionally commit after each complex extraction in Phase 3
- Clear commit messages with metrics
- Meaningful commit history for future debugging

**Warning Signs:**

- One giant commit at the end
- Commit messages like "WIP" or "refactoring"
- No metrics in commit messages
- Days of work without commits

### Pitfall 9: Ignoring or Deferring Documentation

**Problem:** Developer skips Phase 4 or creates minimal documentation.

**Consequence:** Future maintainers struggle to understand refactored code, benefits lost over time.

**Solution:**

- Phase 4 is NOT optional
- Invest 10% of time in comprehensive documentation
- Create summary document with before/after metrics
- Enhance run() docstring with 50+ lines
- Document design patterns used

**Warning Signs:**

- "We can document later"
- run() docstring unchanged from original
- No summary document created
- Missing "See Also" references

### Pitfall 10: Stopping at "Good Enough"

**Problem:** Developer stops at 50% complexity reduction instead of pushing to 85%.

**Consequence:** Function still hard to maintain, benefits not fully realized.

**Solution:**

- Target is 85% reduction, not 50%
- If stuck at 50%, identify highest remaining complexity areas
- Extract more complex helpers in Phase 3
- Use complexity tools to verify final target met

**Warning Signs:**

- "That's probably good enough"
- Complexity reduced from 69 to 30 (56% reduction)
- run() still has nested conditionals
- Stopping because "it's taking too long"

## Lessons Learned

### From PR #10 (runner.py): 85% Complexity Reduction

**What Worked Well:**

1. **Risk Reduction Activities:**
   - Identifying empty DataFrame edge case BEFORE refactoring prevented regression
   - Cost tracker integration tests caught state management issues early

2. **Incremental Extraction:**
   - Extracting one method at a time made debugging trivial
   - When tests failed, we knew exactly which extraction caused the issue

3. **Template Method Pattern:**
   - run() became a clear 8-step orchestration
   - Easy for reviewers to understand at a glance

**Challenges:**

1. **Initial Time Investment:**
   - Phase 0 took longer than expected (4 hours vs planned 3)
   - Worth it: caught 2 edge cases that would have been bugs

2. **Dataclass Design:**
   - First design had too many fields (12+)
   - Refined to 2 focused dataclasses with 5-6 fields each

3. **Helper Method Naming:**
   - Initial names were too generic (_process_row, _handle_result)
   - Improved to specific names (_build_prompt_inputs,_execute_llm_call)

**Key Insight:** Spending 30-40% of time on Phase 0 is the secret to zero-regression refactoring.

### From PR #11 (suite_runner.py): 88.4% Complexity Reduction

**What Worked Well:**

1. **Behavioral Documentation:**
   - Writing 557-line sink resolution doc clarified implementation
   - Discovered missing functionality during documentation (plugin registration gap)

2. **Middleware Hook Tracer:**
   - Custom test helper made deduplication logic testable
   - Verified subtle id() behavior works correctly

3. **Flow Diagrams:**
   - ASCII baseline flow diagram made timing invariants crystal clear
   - Reviewers appreciated visual representation

**Challenges:**

1. **Test Infrastructure:**
   - Had to create CollectingSink plugin registration for tests
   - Time investment: 1 hour, but enabled 60% of sink resolution tests

2. **Complex Extraction Sequencing:**
   - Initially tried to extract baseline comparison in one step
   - Too complex, broke into 2 methods (_merge_baseline_plugin_defs + _run_baseline_comparison)

3. **Review Feedback:**
   - Peer reviewer found failing tests (expected - draft PR)
   - Quick diagnosis prevented alarm (test bug, not production bug)

**Key Insight:** For very complex functions (complexity ≥ 60), risk reduction activities are CRITICAL. Don't skip them!

### Cross-Project Learnings

**Universal Principles:**

1. **Test-First is Non-Negotiable:**
   - Every successful refactoring started with 80%+ coverage
   - Attempting refactoring with <70% coverage is gambling

2. **One Thing at a Time:**
   - Complexity reduction is separate from feature work
   - Behavior changes are separate from structure changes
   - Mixing concerns leads to failed PRs

3. **Documentation Pays Off:**
   - Writing flow diagrams clarifies your own understanding
   - "If I can't explain it clearly, I don't understand it well enough"

4. **Commit Frequently:**
   - Small commits make rollback easy
   - Clear history helps future debugging
   - Reviewers prefer 5 small commits over 1 giant commit

5. **Design Patterns are Your Friend:**
   - Template Method pattern consistently reduced complexity 80%+
   - Parameter Object pattern eliminated parameter list complexity
   - Guard Clause pattern eliminated nesting

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**

1. **The Big Rewrite:**
   - Trying to refactor everything at once fails
   - Incremental refactoring succeeds

2. **Perfect is the Enemy of Done:**
   - Aiming for 100% complexity reduction delays merge
   - 85% reduction is the sweet spot (achievable + high value)

3. **Clever Code:**
   - Refactoring is about making code SIMPLER, not cleverer
   - If a reviewer needs 10 minutes to understand, it's too clever

4. **Documentation Debt:**
   - "We'll document it later" never happens
   - Document during refactoring while context is fresh

## Non-Functional Invariants

**New in v1.1:** Beyond behavioral correctness, refactoring should preserve performance, memory usage, logging structure, and security posture.

### Concept: Customizable for Your System

The specific metrics and tools will vary by project. **Tailor this checklist to your system's critical non-functional requirements.** Not all projects need all metrics - focus on what matters for your production environment.

### Baseline Capture (Phase 0)

Consider tracking these categories:

**1. Performance (Runtime)**
- **Metrics:** p50/p95/p99 runtime for representative inputs
- **Tools:** `pytest --durations=10`, custom benchmark scripts, `timeit`
- **Tolerance:** ±5% runtime delta typically acceptable
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  # Capture baseline
  pytest tests/test_<target>*.py --durations=10 > baseline_perf.txt

  # After refactoring, compare
  pytest tests/test_<target>*.py --durations=10 > refactored_perf.txt
  diff baseline_perf.txt refactored_perf.txt
  ```

**2. Memory (Heap/RSS)**
- **Metrics:** Peak RSS, heap size for standard run
- **Tools:** `memory_profiler`, `tracemalloc`, `psutil`
- **Tolerance:** ±10% memory delta typically acceptable
- **Example:**
  ```python
  import tracemalloc
  tracemalloc.start()
  result = target_function(data)
  current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
  print(f"Peak memory: {peak / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
  ```

**3. Logging Structure**
- **Metrics:** Event count, severity distribution, structured log keys
- **Critical:** Maintain exact structured log keys for downstream consumers
- **Tolerance:** Zero changes to log keys (breaking change for log aggregators)
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  # Parse logs and count by level
  grep "INFO\|WARNING\|ERROR" logs.txt | sort | uniq -c
  ```

**4. Security Posture**
- **Metrics:** Unchanged permissions, sink access patterns, redaction paths
- **Critical:** Zero changes to security-relevant code paths
- **Review:** Manual security review of any changes near:
  - Permission checks
  - Data sanitization/redaction
  - Sink security level evaluation
  - Plugin context propagation

### Verification (Phase 4)

Re-measure all captured baselines and compare:

```markdown
## Non-Functional Verification

**Performance:**
- p50 runtime: 120ms → 118ms (✅ -1.7%, within ±5%)
- p95 runtime: 250ms → 248ms (✅ -0.8%, within ±5%)

**Memory:**
- Peak RSS: 45MB → 46MB (✅ +2.2%, within ±10%)

**Logging:**
- INFO events: 42 → 42 (✅ unchanged)
- WARNING events: 2 → 2 (✅ unchanged)
- ERROR events: 0 → 0 (✅ unchanged)
- Structured log keys: Unchanged (✅ verified)

**Security:**
- Permission checks: Unchanged (✅ manual review)
- Sink security levels: Unchanged (✅ verified)
- No new security-relevant code paths (✅ confirmed)
```

**Action if out of tolerance:** Investigate root cause. Performance regressions > 10% warrant investigation even if code is "correct."

## Tools & Configurations

**New in v1.1:** Specific tool configurations and setup guidance.

### Mutation Testing Tools

**Primary: mutmut (Recommended for most projects)**

- **License:** BSD 3-Clause (free, open source)
- **Cost:** $0
- **Complexity:** ⭐⭐ (Low - simple CLI, minimal config)
- **Installation:** `pip install mutmut`
- **Use Case:** Most refactorings, straightforward setup

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
# Run mutation testing on target file
mutmut run --paths-to-mutate src/<path>/target.py

# View results
mutmut results

# Show surviving mutants (these indicate weak tests)
mutmut show

# Target: ≤ 10% survivors
```

**Advanced: cosmic-ray (Optional for large codebases)**

- **License:** MIT (free, open source)
- **Cost:** $0
- **Complexity:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High - requires configuration, more complex setup)
- **Installation:** `pip install cosmic-ray`
- **Use Case:** Large projects needing parallel execution, more comprehensive mutation operators

**When to use cosmic-ray:**
- Codebase > 50k lines
- Need parallel test execution
- Want more comprehensive mutation coverage

**Recommendation:** Start with mutmut. Only move to cosmic-ray if mutmut performance inadequate.

### Type Checking Configuration

**MyPy Configuration (`mypy.ini` or `pyproject.toml`):**

```ini
# mypy.ini
[mypy]
python_version = 3.11  # Or your minimum version
strict = True
warn_return_any = True
warn_unused_configs = True
disallow_untyped_defs = True
disallow_any_generics = True
no_implicit_optional = True

# Per-module overrides if needed
[mypy-tests.*]
disallow_untyped_defs = False  # Relax for test files
```

**Or in `pyproject.toml`:**
```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.11"
strict = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
```

**Run MyPy after EVERY extraction:**
```bash
mypy src/<path>/target.py
```

### Linting Configuration

**Ruff Configuration (`pyproject.toml`):**

```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
target-version = "py311"

# Select rule categories
select = [
    "E",   # pycodestyle errors
    "F",   # pyflakes
    "I",   # isort
    "N",   # pep8-naming
    "UP",  # pyupgrade
    "C90", # mccabe complexity
    "B",   # flake8-bugbear
    "S",   # flake8-bandit (security)
]

ignore = [
    "E501",  # Line length (handled by formatter)
]

[tool.ruff.mccabe]
max-complexity = 15  # Flag functions needing refactoring
```

**Run Ruff after EVERY extraction:**
```bash
ruff check src/<path>/target.py
```

### Complexity Measurement

**Radon (lightweight, free):**

```bash
# Install
pip install radon

# Measure complexity
radon cc src/<path>/target.py -s

# Expected output before refactoring:
# M 69:4 target - B (69)  # B = high complexity

# Expected output after refactoring:
# M 69:4 target - A (8)   # A = low complexity
```

**SonarQube (enterprise-grade, optional):**

- More comprehensive analysis
- Tracks technical debt
- Integrates with CI/CD
- May require license for private repos (check SonarCloud for open source)

### Test Framework

**Pytest with Coverage:**

```bash
# Install
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src/<path>/target.py tests/test_<target>*.py

# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=src/<path>/target.py --cov-report=html tests/test_<target>*.py

# View HTML report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

**Target:** ≥ 80% coverage before starting Phase 1

## Troubleshooting

**New in v1.1:** Common issues, symptoms, diagnosis, and solutions.

### Issue 1: Tests Failing After Extraction

**Symptoms:**
- Tests that passed before extraction now fail
- Assertion errors or unexpected output
- MyPy reports type mismatches

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1. **Check extracted method signature matches original behavior:**
   ```python
   # Did you change parameter order?
   # Did you change return type?
   # Did you add/remove parameters?
   ```

2. **Verify all state passed correctly to helper:**
   ```python
   # Are all required variables accessible in helper?
   # Did you forget to pass a parameter?
   # Is `self` state being modified correctly?
   ```

3. **Look for accidental mutation of shared state:**
   ```python
   # Are you modifying a dict/list in place?
   # Did you break an assumption about state order?
   ```

**Solution:**

- **Immediate:** Revert the extraction
  ```bash
  git reset --hard HEAD~1  # If committed
  # OR
  git checkout -- src/<path>/target.py  # If not committed
  ```

- **Investigate:** Why did tests fail?
  - Add print statements to see actual vs expected values
  - Use debugger to step through execution
  - Compare extracted code carefully against original

- **Retry:** Try smaller extraction or different approach
  - Extract fewer lines
  - Keep more context in the helper
  - Add intermediate helper methods

### Issue 2: Complexity Not Reducing Enough

**Symptoms:**
- After Phase 3, complexity only reduced 40-50% (target: ≥ 85%)
- Helper methods still have complexity > 10
- run() method still has nested blocks

**Diagnosis:**

1. **Too few helpers extracted:**
   - Count helper methods: should be 10-15 total, not 5-7
   - Check if complex blocks remain in run()

2. **Helpers too large:**
   - Check helper line counts: should be 5-40 lines each
   - If helper > 40 lines, it's doing too much

3. **Guards not used effectively:**
   - Count early returns in run() and helpers
   - Nested conditionals indicate missing guard clauses

**Solution:**

- **Target 10-15 helpers, not 5-7:** More granular responsibility
- **Break large helpers into sub-helpers:**
  ```python
  # Instead of one 60-line helper:
  def _run_baseline_comparison():  # 60 lines, complexity 18
      # ... 60 lines of logic

  # Split into 2-3 helpers:
  def _merge_baseline_plugin_defs():  # 15 lines, complexity 3
      # ... merge logic only

  def _execute_baseline_plugins():  # 20 lines, complexity 5
      # ... execution logic only

  def _notify_baseline_comparison():  # 10 lines, complexity 2
      # ... notification logic only
  ```

- **Add guard clauses at start of each helper:**
  ```python
  def _run_baseline_comparison(self, experiment, ctx, ...):
      # Early exit: only compare non-baseline experiments
      if not ctx.baseline_payload or experiment == self.suite.baseline:
          return  # Guard clause eliminates nested if

      # ... rest of logic without nesting
  ```

### Issue 3: Too Many Parameters (>5)

**Symptoms:**
- Helper method has 6+ parameters
- Parameter list hard to remember
- Type hints make signature very long

**Diagnosis:**
- Method is either:
  1. Doing too much (needs further splitting)
  2. Needs a Parameter Object (dataclass)

**Solution:**

**Option 1: Use dataclass to group related parameters:**
```python
# BEFORE: 7 parameters
def _run_baseline_comparison(
    self,
    experiment,
    ctx,
    current_payload,
    pack,
    defaults,
    middlewares,
    experiment_context,
):
    # ...

# AFTER: 3 parameters (group related ones into dataclass)
@dataclass
class BaselineComparisonConfig:
    experiment: ExperimentConfig
    current_payload: dict[str, Any]
    pack: dict[str, Any] | None
    defaults: dict[str, Any]
    middlewares: list[Any]
    experiment_context: PluginContext

def _run_baseline_comparison(self, config: BaselineComparisonConfig, ctx: SuiteExecutionContext):
    # Access via config.experiment, config.current_payload, etc.
```

**Option 2: Method might be doing too much - split further:**
- If parameters fall into 2-3 distinct groups, extract separate helpers

### Issue 4: When to Stop and Ask for Help

**Red Flags:**

- [ ] Tests failing repeatedly after extractions (>3 failures)
- [ ] Complexity not reducing despite extracting 10+ methods
- [ ] Stuck on same extraction for > 2 hours
- [ ] Breaking existing tests to make them pass (❌ WRONG)
- [ ] Time investment > 15 hours

**Action:**

1. **Stop refactoring immediately**
2. **Document current state:**
   - What's been attempted
   - What's failing
   - Current complexity metrics

3. **Consult:**
   - Full METHODOLOGY.md for guidance
   - Team members who've done this before
   - Consider pairing with experienced developer

4. **Consider deferring:**
   - Some functions are genuinely hard to refactor
   - May need architectural changes first
   - ROI may not be worth the effort

**Remember:** It's okay to defer. Not every function is worth refactoring right now.

## Conclusion

This methodology has proven effective across 2 complexity reduction refactorings with:

- **100% success rate** (2/2 PRs merged without regressions)
- **86.7% average complexity reduction** (exceeded 85% target)
- **0 behavioral changes** (100% test pass rate maintained)
- **0 bugs introduced** (30-day post-merge monitoring)

The key to success is disciplined adherence to the five-phase process, with particular emphasis on:

1. Comprehensive test coverage BEFORE any refactoring (Phase 0)
2. Incremental extraction with continuous testing (Phases 2-3)
3. Thorough documentation for future maintainers (Phase 4)

By following this methodology, you can confidently reduce complexity in critical codebase functions while maintaining zero behavioral changes and 100% test coverage.
