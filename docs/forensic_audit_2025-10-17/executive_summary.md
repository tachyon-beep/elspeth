**Executive Summary**

Decision: **ACCEPT** (confidence: Likely). All AIS gates—tests, coverage, guardrails, SBOM, and deterministic builds—now pass with artefacts captured for traceability.

**Supporting Observations**
- Regression suite is green across 698 tests with deterministic CLI/suite workflows restored (`test_results.txt:1-12`).
- Line coverage increased to 85.0% (branches 71.7%), clearing the programme threshold while exercising the schema validation and certification paths (`coverage.xml:2`).
- Secret scanning now runs on every PR/merge with gitleaks JSON artefacts uploaded for audit trails (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:15`).
- Retrieval embedders and Azure Search clients now refuse non-approved endpoints, closing the data exfiltration vector highlighted during the initial audit (`src/elspeth/retrieval/service.py:40-69`, `src/elspeth/retrieval/providers.py:137-196`).
- Dependency stacks are pinned and reproducible via `scripts/bootstrap.sh` with hash-locked requirement sets (`requirements.lock`, `requirements-dev.lock`).
- Plugin certification policy tightened: every plugin must declare explicit `security_level` and `determinism_level`, eliminating the drift that previously caused registry divergences (`src/elspeth/core/registries/plugin_helpers.py:117-152`).
- Telemetry hooks remain intact—retry summaries and cost tracking surface when LLM attempts exhaust, giving operations actionable signals (`src/elspeth/core/experiments/runner.py:209-229`, `661-682`).

**Implications**
- AIS submission can proceed with the refreshed artefacts bundle (tests, coverage, SBOM) demonstrating compliance with determinism and security policies.
- Endpoint guardrails and lockfiles now satisfy the MF-4 External Service Approval and reproducibility controls, reducing supply-chain exposure for mission-critical deployments.
