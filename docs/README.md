# ELSPETH Documentation

Index of the documentation shipped in this repository.

**Framework status:** `0.5.0` (RC-5 line)
**Tracking note:** active delivery work lives in Filigree; many docs under `release/`,
`plans/`, `analysis/`, `audits/`, and `arch-analysis-*` are intentionally
point-in-time snapshots.
