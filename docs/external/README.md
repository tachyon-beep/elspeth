# External Documents (Legacy)

This folder previously contained external PDFs used during early design and audits.
They are not part of the maintained documentation set.

- Large binary files bloat the repository and are difficult to review.
- We track current architecture and compliance material under `docs/`.

Recommendation: delete any remaining PDFs in this folder. If a document is still
useful, link to its canonical source or convert it into a maintained Markdown doc
under `docs/`.
