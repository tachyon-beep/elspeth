## RC-3.3 — Architectural Remediation (March 2026)

4-phase remediation sprint driven by full architecture analysis (23 documents). Focus: audit integrity hardening, layer enforcement, plugin decomposition, and elimination of defensive-pattern violations.

**Branch:** `RC3.3-architectural-remediation`

### Highlights

- **LLM plugin consolidation (T10)** — 6 LLM transforms collapsed into unified `LLMTransform` with provider dispatch (~3,300 lines removed)
- **Frozen audit records (T1)** — All 25 dataclasses in `contracts/audit.py` frozen, preventing silent Tier 1 audit trail corruption
- **PluginContext protocol split (T17)** — God-object `PluginContext` decomposed into 4 phase-based protocols (`SourceContext`, `TransformContext`, `SinkContext`, `LifecycleContext`)
- **Orchestrator decomposition (T18)** — Extract-method refactoring of the two largest engine files to ≤150 line methods
- **Landscape repository pattern (T19)** — `LandscapeRecorder` refactored from 8 mixins into 4 composed domain repositories
- **Plugins restructure** — Flat `plugins/` directory reorganized into 4 SDA-aligned subfolders (`infrastructure/`, `sources/`, `transforms/`, `sinks/`)
- **Layer enforcement (T6, T7, ADR-006)** — 10 cross-layer violations eliminated, strict 4-layer model enforced by CI

### Breaking Changes (RC-3.3)

- **LLM plugin names changed:** `azure_llm`, `openrouter_llm`, `azure_multi_query_llm`, `openrouter_multi_query_llm` replaced by unified `plugin: llm` with `provider: azure|openrouter` and `mode: single|multi_query`
- **Plugin import paths changed:** `plugins.base` → `plugins.infrastructure.base`, `plugins.config_base` → `plugins.infrastructure.config_base`, etc.
- **Model loader renames:** 15 DTO mapper classes renamed from `*Repository` to `*Loader` (e.g., `RunRepository` → `RunLoader`, `repositories.py` → `model_loaders.py`)

### Architecture Changes (RC-3.3)

#### T10: LLM Plugin Consolidation

Collapsed 6 LLM transform classes (~4,950 lines) into unified `LLMTransform` with strategy pattern:
- `LLMProvider` protocol handles transport (Azure SDK vs OpenRouter HTTP)
- `SingleQueryStrategy` / `MultiQueryStrategy` handle row logic
- Shared `LangfuseTracer` handles tracing
- Old plugin names raise `ValueError` with migration guidance
- 16 example YAMLs and 10 docs updated

#### T1: Frozen Audit Records

Added `frozen=True` to all 16 previously-mutable audit record dataclasses. All 25 dataclasses in `contracts/audit.py` are now immutable. Mutations crash at the mutation site instead of silently corrupting the audit trail.

#### T2: Assert Removal

Replaced 18 `assert` statements across 10 plugin files with explicit `if/raise RuntimeError` patterns. Python's `-O` flag strips asserts, silently removing safety checks.

#### T3: Truthiness Checks

Fixed 21 truthiness checks across 8 files. Python's `if x:` silently excludes valid zero values (`0`, `0.0`) and empty strings. All replaced with explicit `is not None` checks.

#### T6--T7: Layer Violation Fixes

- T6: Moved `ExpressionParser` from `engine/` to `core/` (L1→L2 violation)
- T7: Moved `MaxRetriesExceeded` to `contracts/errors.py`, `BufferEntry` to `contracts/engine.py` (L0→L2/L3 violations)
- New `RuntimeServiceRateLimit` frozen dataclass replaces runtime L0→L1 import

#### T17: PluginContext Protocol Split

Decomposed god-object `PluginContext` (20+ fields) into 4 phase-based protocols:
- `SourceContext` (11 fields) — for `load()` methods
- `TransformContext` (12 fields) — for `process()` / `accept()` methods
- `SinkContext` (7 fields) — for `write()` methods
- `LifecycleContext` (7 fields) — for `on_start()` / `on_complete()` methods

23 plugin files updated. Concrete `PluginContext` structurally satisfies all 4 protocols.

#### T18: Orchestrator/Processor Decomposition

Pure extract-method refactoring:
- 7 methods extracted from `orchestrator/core.py` (largest: `_run_main_processing_loop` ~200→~90 lines)
- 3 methods extracted from `processor.py`
- New typed infrastructure: `GraphArtifacts`, `RunContext`, `LoopContext` parameter bundles

#### T19: Landscape Repository Pattern

Refactored `LandscapeRecorder` from 8 mixins into 4 composed domain repositories:
- `RunLifecycleRepository` (645 lines) — run lifecycle, graph registration, export
- `ExecutionRepository` (1,472 lines) — node states, call tracking, batch management
- `DataFlowRepository` (1,435 lines) — rows, tokens, errors, graph structure
- `QueryRepository` (532 lines) — read-only cross-cutting queries

`LandscapeRecorder` is now a pure delegation facade (1,040 lines, ~91 public methods, zero logic).

#### Plugins Restructure (SDA Alignment)

Reorganized flat `plugins/` into 4 SDA-aligned subfolders:
- `plugins/infrastructure/` — shared base classes, protocols, config, discovery (29 files)
- `plugins/sources/` — CSV, JSON, Null, Azure Blob sources (4 plugins)
- `plugins/transforms/` — all transforms including LLM and Azure safety (12+ plugins)
- `plugins/sinks/` — CSV, JSON, Database, Azure Blob sinks (4 plugins)

247 files changed, ~460 test imports rewritten.

#### ADR-006: Layer Dependency Remediation

Documents the strict 4-layer model (`contracts → core → engine → plugins`) and the 10→0 violation fix strategy. Enforced by CI via `enforce_tier_model.py`.

### Bug Fixes (RC-3.3)

- 10 silent failure findings remediated in LLM plugins (Langfuse, tracing, finish reasons, content filtering)
- 4 bugs fixed in unified `LLMTransform` (limiter dispatch, response_format, output_fields extraction, NaN/Infinity rejection)

- BatchReplicate quarantine audit gap (per-token terminal recording)
- KeywordFilter fail-closed on non-string values (was fail-open)
- Multi-query regressions from T10 (field type validation, pooled execution, Pydantic schema, output_schema_config)
- LLM empty/whitespace content detection at provider boundary
- Telemetry/Landscape hash divergence (hashes now read from recorded Call object)
- URL password fingerprint percent-encoding
- TUI coalesce error crash on older record shapes
- CLI explain passphrase silently swallowed (T4), MCP diagnose quarantine count unscoped (T5), ChaosLLM MCP CLI broken (T27)

- Code review remediation: 4 critical, 8 important, 6 suggestion fixes

### Test Infrastructure Overhaul (RC-3.3)

6-phase systematic hardening of the test suite, eliminating brittle coupling to internal constructors and enforcing production code paths:

- **P0.5a--b**: New factories (`make_recorder_with_run()`, `register_test_node()`, etc.) + refactored existing factories to single delegation point
- **P1**: Replaced ~350 direct `PluginContext(...)` constructions across 53 files with centralized `make_context()` factory
- **P2**: Replaced ~452 inline `LandscapeDB.in_memory()`/`LandscapeRecorder(...)` constructions across 76 files with factory calls (net −715 lines)
- **P3**: Replaced ~529 lines of duplicated inline test plugin classes across 10 files with shared `tests.fixtures.plugins` imports
- **P4**: Re-raise guards, frozen evidence types (`ExceptionResult`, `FailureInfo`), aggregation DRY via `accumulate_row_outcomes()` + `ExecutionCounters`
- Resolved all 401 mypy errors across test suite (103 files, ~74 stale `# type: ignore` removed)

### Tests (RC-3.3)

- ~150 new tests across hardening, code review, and infrastructure phases
- Full suite: **10,563 tests collected**, 16 skipped, 3 xfailed
- mypy/ruff/contracts all clean

### Dead Code Removal (RC-3.3)

- `BaseLLMTransform` abstract class (3,473 lines, zero subclasses)
- `RequestRecord` dataclass (never instantiated)
- `TokenManager.payload_store` parameter (accepted but never read)
- `populate_run()` (raw SQL bypass of `LandscapeRecorder`)
- LLM validation utilities (`render_template_safe`, `check_truncation`)
- ~21 low-value tests (vacuous assertions, mock-testing, implementation coupling)

### Other Additions (RC-3.3)

- Security posture brief documenting threat model, controls, and residual risk
- TYPE_CHECKING layer import detection in `enforce_tier_model.py` CI gate
- `PluginBundle` frozen dataclass for typed plugin instantiation results
- Fingerprint primitives moved to `contracts/security.py` (stdlib-only)
- MCP server `_ToolDef` registry replacing if/elif dispatch chain

---

## RC-3.0 Highlights

- **Routing trilogy completed** -- three-phase architectural overhaul replaces implicit `default_sink` routing with fully declarative DAG wiring (ADR-004, ADR-005). Every edge in the pipeline is now explicit.
- **Gate plugins removed entirely** -- routing is config-driven only via `GateSettings` and `ExpressionParser`. Approximately 3,000 lines of gate plugin infrastructure deleted.
- **Test suite v2 migration complete** -- 7-phase cutover from v1 (7,487 tests, 507 files, 222K lines deleted) to v2 (8,138 tests). Property testing expanded with Hypothesis.
- **Graceful shutdown** -- cooperative signal handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT) with aggregation buffer flush, checkpoint creation, and resumable interrupted runs.
- **65+ remediation items resolved** from the RC-2 comprehensive architecture analysis (75+ original findings).

---

## Breaking Changes

These changes are incompatible with RC-2 configurations and checkpoints. Since ELSPETH has no external users yet, no migration tooling is provided.

### Explicit `on_success` routing replaces implicit `default_sink`

The `default_sink` configuration field has been removed. Every terminal node must declare an explicit `on_success` target. Source nodes also require `on_success`.

**Before (RC-2):**
```yaml
default_sink: output
source:
  plugin: csv
  options: { path: input.csv }
transforms:
  - plugin: classifier
    on_error: quarantine
```

**After (RC-3):**
```yaml
source:
  plugin: csv
  options:
    path: input.csv
  on_success: output
transforms:
  - plugin: classifier
    on_error: quarantine
    on_success: output
```

See [ADR-004: Explicit Sink Routing](../architecture/adr/004-adr-explicit-sink-routing.md) for the full rationale.

### Explicit `input` wiring replaces positional ordering

Transforms, gates, and aggregation nodes now declare their input connection by name via the `input:` field. Positional ordering in the YAML no longer determines dataflow.

```yaml
source:
  plugin: csv
  options: { path: input.csv }
  on_success: raw_data

transforms:
  - plugin: enricher
    name: enricher
    input: raw_data
    on_success: enriched
  - plugin: classifier
    name: classifier
    input: enriched
    on_success: output

sinks:
  output: { plugin: csv, options: { path: results.csv } }
```

Connection names and sink names occupy separate namespaces. A collision between the two is a `GraphValidationError`. See [ADR-005: Declarative DAG Wiring](../architecture/adr/005-adr-declarative-dag-wiring.md).

### Gate plugins removed

Gate plugins (`GateProtocol`, `BaseGate`, `execute_gate()`, `PluginGateReason`) have been deleted from the codebase. Routing is exclusively config-driven via `GateSettings` with `ExpressionParser` (AST-based, no `eval`). This is a hard prohibition -- gate plugin infrastructure will not be reintroduced.

### `on_success` lifted to settings level

The `on_success` field has been moved from plugin `options:` to the top-level settings for all node types, aligning with how `on_error` is already configured. This applies to transforms, sources, aggregations, and coalesce nodes.

### Node ID derivation changed

Node IDs are now derived from `settings.name` instead of `plugin_name + sequence_number`. This makes node IDs position-independent and human-readable in audit records. Existing checkpoints are incompatible.

### Test suite restructured

The `tests/` directory has been completely restructured. The v1 suite (507 files, 222K lines) was deleted and replaced with the v2 suite. Import paths changed across 123 files (204 import rewrites).

### Pre-2026-01-24 checkpoints incompatible

All checkpoints created before 2026-01-24 are invalid due to node ID format changes introduced in the routing refactor. Attempting to resume from a pre-2026-01-24 checkpoint will fail with a clear error message. Delete old checkpoint files and re-run affected pipelines.

---

## New Features

### Graceful Shutdown (FEAT-05, FEAT-05b)

Cooperative shutdown via `threading.Event`. Signal handler sets the event; the processing loop checks between rows.

- First SIGINT/SIGTERM: flush aggregation buffers, write pending tokens to sinks, create checkpoint, mark run `INTERRUPTED`
- Second SIGINT: force-kill
- CLI exits with code 3 on graceful shutdown
- Interrupted runs are resumable via `elspeth resume`
- Shutdown flag checked on quarantine path and resume path
- 16 tests (9 unit + 7 integration)

**Commits:** `6286367f` (FEAT-05), `9a9fd8ca` (quarantine path), `d2a6cbef` (FEAT-05b resume path)

### Declarative DAG Wiring (ADR-004, ADR-005)

The routing trilogy -- three sequential phases that replaced ELSPETH's implicit routing model with fully declarative wiring:

1. **Phase 1** (ADR-004, `elspeth-rapid-o639`): Explicit `on_success` routing. Removed `default_sink` and its ~472 references across 50 test files and 30 example YAMLs.
2. **Phase 2** (`elspeth-rapid-hscm`): Processor node-ID refactoring. Replaced `start_step` integer indexing with `current_node_id`-based DAG traversal.
3. **Phase 3** (ADR-005, `elspeth-rapid-tbia`): Declarative `input:` wiring. Replaced positional edge inference with named connection matching. ~900+ reference updates.

Key design decisions:
- Connection and sink namespaces are separate (collision is a validation error)
- `settings.name` drives node IDs (position-independent, human-readable)
- `branch_name` is lineage metadata only, never used for routing
- Aggregations stay post-transform; mid-chain aggregations deferred

### Per-Branch Fork Transforms (ARCH-15)

Fork branches can now have intermediate transforms before reaching coalesce. `CoalesceSettings.branches` accepts dict format (`{branch_name: input_connection}`) to wire per-branch transform chains. List format (`[a, b]`) normalizes to identity dict (`{a: a, b: b}`) — fully backward compatible.

- `ExecutionGraph.get_branch_first_nodes()` provides O(1) dispatch to first transform per branch
- DAG builder: conditional producer registration (identity branches use COPY edges, transform branches use connection resolution)
- Strategy-aware schema validation: union merges check type compatibility across branches; nested/select skip cross-branch checks
- 23 new tests (10 unit, 8 property, 5 integration)

**Commit:** `83a6d40a`

### DROP-Mode Sentinel Requeue Handling

Prevents DROP-mode sentinel requeue failure from raising to callers. Fixes a race condition where shutdown sentinels could fail to requeue in telemetry DROP mode.

**Commits:** `bbc2f515`, `3af35d0d` (race fix), `1acec271` (flush join guarantee)

### Call Index Seeding on Resume (SAFE-05)

Call index is now seeded from `MAX(call_index)` on resume, preventing UNIQUE constraint violations when resuming runs that made external calls.

**Commit:** `b60cdcd9`

### ExecutionGraph Public API (TEST-01)

13 public setter methods and 5 method renames on `ExecutionGraph`. Over 60 private attribute accesses eliminated from tests, replaced with proper public API calls.

**Commit:** `1c31869b`

## Architecture Changes

### Routing Trilogy (3 Phases)

The routing trilogy is the single largest architectural change in RC-3. It touched every layer of the system:

- **Phase 1 -- Explicit Sink Routing:** Removed `default_sink` and 40+ fallback chains. Separated `branch_name` (lineage) from routing (now `on_success` only). ~472 references updated.
- **Phase 2 -- Processor Node-ID Refactoring:** Replaced `start_step` integer indexing with `current_node_id` DAG traversal. Processor now follows graph edges rather than list positions.
- **Phase 3 -- Declarative DAG Wiring:** Replaced positional edge inference with named connection matching via `input:` fields. ~900+ references updated.

### Gate Plugin Removal (~3,000 Lines Deleted)

`GateProtocol`, `BaseGate`, `execute_gate()`, and `PluginGateReason` were deleted from source and tests. Routing is exclusively config-driven via `GateSettings` + `ExpressionParser` (AST-based, no `eval`). This is a hard prohibition documented in project memory.

### Engine Package Refactoring

Single-file modules refactored into packages:
- `engine/orchestrator.py` became `engine/orchestrator/` (core, aggregation, export, outcomes, types, validation)
- `engine/executors.py` became `engine/executors/` (transform, gate, sink, aggregation, types)

### Contract Hardening

Extensive work on the contracts subsystem throughout the sprint:
- Strict field lookup with immutable schema indices
- Normalized violation error keys
- Deterministic contract audit ordering
- Plugin name contract enforcement during discovery
- Unknown plugin hook rejection during registration

### Unused Session Parameter Removal (ARCH-13)

Removed unused `session` parameter from all Loader classes.

**Commit:** `b60cdcd9`

### ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [ADR-004](../architecture/adr/004-adr-explicit-sink-routing.md) | Explicit Sink Routing | Approved, Implemented |
| [ADR-005](../architecture/adr/005-adr-declarative-dag-wiring.md) | Declarative DAG Wiring | Approved, Implemented |

---

## Known Issues

### Open (7 remaining)

| ID | Summary | Priority |
|----|---------|----------|
| CRIT-02 | `.get("usage") or {}` chains on LLM API responses (4 files) | MEDIUM |
| FEAT-04 | Missing CLI commands (`status`, `export`, `db migrate`) | MEDIUM |
| FEAT-06 | No circuit breaker in retry logic | MEDIUM |
| ARCH-06 | AggregationExecutor maintains 6 parallel dictionaries | MEDIUM |
| ARCH-14 | Resume schema verification gap (no schema fingerprint) | MEDIUM |
| QW-10 | CLI event formatters not extracted (~2,000 lines monolithic) | LOW |
| OBS-04 | No Prometheus-style pull metrics | LOW |

### Known Flaky Test

`tests/core/rate_limit/test_limiter.py::test_acquire_within_limit` -- timing-dependent, occasionally fails under CI load.

### Known Limitation

Aggregation timeout triggers fire when the next row arrives, not during completely idle periods. If no rows arrive after the timeout elapses, buffered data waits until either a new row arrives or the source completes. Combine timeout with count triggers, or implement heartbeat rows at the source level.
