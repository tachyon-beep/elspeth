## Overview

This document tracks daily progress on the ATO (Authority to Operate) remediation work program. The work program addresses findings from the architectural assessment documented in `external/1. ARCHITECTURAL DOCUMENT SET.pdf`.

## Week 1: Must-Fix Foundation (Oct 15-19, 2025)

### 2025-10-15 (Day 1)

#### ✅ Completed Tasks

**MF-1: Remove Legacy Code - COMPLETE** 🎉
- ✅ Verified old/ directory removed (commit 47da6d9)
- ✅ Confirmed no legacy imports in codebase
- ✅ Confirmed no legacy namespace references
- ✅ Created ADR 003 documenting removal decision
- ✅ Created automated verification script (`scripts/verify-no-legacy-code.sh`)
- ✅ Created daily verification script (`scripts/daily-verification.sh`)
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to prevent old/ recreation
- ✅ All tests passing (572 passed, 1 skipped)
- ✅ Coverage: 84% overall
- ✅ Committed in 7c6453e

**ATO Work Program Created**
- ✅ Created comprehensive 27-page work program (`ATO_REMEDIATION_WORK_PROGRAM.md`)
- ✅ Created quick start guide (`ATO_QUICK_START.md`)
- ✅ Created executive summary (`ATO_SUMMARY.md`)
- ✅ Created navigation index (`ATO_INDEX.md`)
- ✅ All verification scripts tested and working

#### 📊 Metrics

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Tests Passing | 572/573 | 100% | ✅ |
| Coverage | 84% | ≥80% | ✅ |
| Linting Errors | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
| Legacy Code References | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
| ADR Documentation | Complete | Complete | ✅ |

#### 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Met

MF-1 Acceptance Criteria:
- ✅ `old/` directory removed from repository
- ✅ `.gitignore` updated to prevent recreation
- ✅ No imports from old code (`grep -r "from old\." src/ tests/`)
- ✅ No module references (`grep -r "import old" src/ tests/`)
- ✅ ADR 003 created and committed
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Verification script created and passing

#### 📝 Notes

**Key Findings:**
- The old/ directory was already removed in commit 47da6d9 (2025-10-14)
- That commit was a comprehensive refactoring that:
  - Removed 26 files of duplicate/shim code
  - Updated ~150 import statements
  - Updated ~80 test files
  - Established clean canonical import paths
- No blocking issues found
- Codebase is in excellent shape for remaining ATO work

**Decisions Made:**
- ADR 003 documents the removal comprehensively
- Verification scripts will be run daily as part of CI/CD
- Progress tracking in this document will be updated daily

#### 🚧 Blockers

**None** - MF-1 completed without any blockers

#### 📅 Next Steps (Oct 16)

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
1. Start MF-2: Plugin Registry Migration
   - Audit current registry usage across codebase
   - Create REGISTRY_MIGRATION_STATUS.md
   - Identify all registry instances to consolidate
   - Begin datasource registry migration

2. Daily Routine:
   - Run `./scripts/daily-verification.sh` before starting work
   - Update this progress document at end of day

**Estimated Effort for MF-2:** 1-2 days
