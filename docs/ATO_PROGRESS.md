   - DEVELOPMENT mode: Permissive for testing (allows mocks, optional security_level)
   - 42 tests, 95% coverage

2. **Config Validation Guards** (config_validation.py)
   - `validate_full_configuration()` - validates datasource, LLM, sinks, middleware
   - `validate_plugin_definition()` - validates individual plugins
   - `validate_suite_configuration()` - validates multi-experiment suites
   - `validate_prompt_pack()` - validates prompt packs
   - 27 tests, 90% coverage

3. **Production Config Templates**
   - `production_suite.yaml` - Complete STRICT mode suite (Azure Blob, real LLM, audit trail)
   - `production_experiment.yaml` - STANDARD mode experiment (local CSV, simplified)
