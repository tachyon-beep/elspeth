- 68 plugins migrated across all registries
- 40% code reduction (eliminated ~800 lines of duplicate code)
- Security enforcement now centralized in BasePluginRegistry
- Type safety improved with generic `BasePluginRegistry[T]`

**Decisions Made:**
- ADR 004 documents the migration comprehensively
- REGISTRY_MIGRATION_STATUS.md provides detailed inventory
- No further migration work needed - verification only

**Benefits Achieved:**
- ✅ 40% code reduction (~800 lines eliminated)
- ✅ Type safety via generics (compile-time checking)
- ✅ Centralized security enforcement (single audit point)
- ✅ Consistent API across all 11 registries

- ✅ Mandatory security level validation

#### 🚧 Blockers (MF-2)

**None** - MF-2 completed without any blockers. Migration was already done!

#### 📅 Next Steps (Oct 16)

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
1. Start MF-3: Secure Configuration
   - Implement secure mode validation
   - Add config schema enforcement
   - Create production config templates

2. Daily Routine:
   - Run `./scripts/daily-verification.sh` before starting work
   - Update this progress document at end of day

**Estimated Effort for MF-3:** 1 day
