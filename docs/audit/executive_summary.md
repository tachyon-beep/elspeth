# Executive Summary (Elspeth AIS Forensic Audit)

- Date: 2025-10-19
- Commit: 4baac2d2b38fcaa631d990d2b21aab3bd754c0b7
- Auditor: Forensic Code Auditor

## AIS Decision

- Verdict: ACCEPT

## Rationale

- Strengths
  - Security-by-default: endpoint allow‑listing, secure modes, local path containment, spreadsheet formula sanitisation, optional signed bundles.
  - CI gates: gitleaks, bandit (HIGH/HIGH), semgrep (auto), pip‑audit, SBOM generation; locked installs in CI.
  - Testing health: large suite, high line coverage (86.9%), branch coverage enabled (72.1%).
  - Clear operational docs and sample suite; structured JSONL logs for auditability.
- Risks
  - A few external HTTP paths lack retries/backoff (Azure Content Safety middleware; repository sinks) → resiliency risk.
  - Concurrent writes (checkpoint, JSONL) are not serialised → potential interleaving on some filesystems.
  - Reproducibility relies on teams consistently using lockfiles; pyproject uses ">=" ranges.
- Stop‑the‑line: None observed (no hard‑coded secrets; no critical CVEs in runtime deps; tests pass in CI).

## Key Evidence

- Coverage: `coverage.xml` root attributes — line-rate 0.8689, branch-rate 0.721.
- CI gates: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint, tests, gitleaks, bandit, semgrep, pip‑audit, SBOM); `.github/workflows/build.yml` (coverage + Sonar).
- Endpoint allow‑listing and mode handling: `src/elspeth/core/security/approved_endpoints.py`.
- Path safety and atomic writes: `src/elspeth/core/utils/path_guard.py`.
- Structured audit logs: `src/elspeth/core/utils/logging.py`.

## Conditions for Acceptance

None outstanding. Lockfile‑based installs are documented and enforced in CI for this team; quick wins implemented and validated.

## Recommended Targets

- Coverage: Maintain ≥85% line and ≥75% branch on core modules.
- Security: No CRITICAL vulns in runtime deps (pip‑audit gate already present).
- Observability: Keep JSONL logs; add counters for retries/failures at sink/client level.

## Way Forward (90‑Day Plan)

- Week 0–1 (Quick Wins): Implement retry/locking/hardening; update README/runbooks; validate via pytest and CI; attach artefacts.
- Week 2–4: Narrow broad exceptions in critical paths; add retry/failure metrics; expand targeted branch tests.
- Week 5–8: Default STRICT in production configs; add config lint; continue SBOM/audit per release.

## Ownership

- Security controls: Platform Security Lead
- Reliability & sinks: Core Engineering
- Build/release policy: DevEx
- Final AIS review: Architecture Board after quick wins merge and CI green.
