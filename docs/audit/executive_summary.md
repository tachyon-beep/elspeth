# Elspeth AIS Forensic Audit — Executive Summary

- Date: 2025-10-18
- Commit: 77227060281db8c1078f725fa39285c56110cc94
- Auditor: Forensic Code Auditor

## AIS Decision

- Decision: CONDITIONAL ACCEPT
- Rationale: Strong overall engineering hygiene (tests, typing, linting, supply‑chain gates, SBOM, and embedded security controls). Remaining gaps are primarily assurance and defense‑in‑depth items appropriate for a mission‑critical system: lift coverage above the recommended bar, add static security scans, and validate HTTP LLM endpoints inside the client constructor to prevent bypass if used outside the registry.

## Highlights (Strengths)

- Security controls in code paths:
  - Endpoint allowlisting and level restrictions (src/elspeth/core/security/approved_endpoints.py).
  - Path containment and atomic writes for local sinks (src/elspeth/core/utils/path_guard.py).
  - Formula sanitization in CSV/Excel sinks (e.g., src/elspeth/plugins/nodes/sinks/csv_file.py).
  - Signed artifact sink with key via env (src/elspeth/plugins/nodes/sinks/signed.py; tests/test_outputs_signed.py).
- Test and quality gates:
  - 744 passed, 1 skipped; coverage.xml emitted; mypy success; ruff clean.
  - CI enforces locked installs, SBOM (CycloneDX), and pip‑audit.
- Observability:
  - Structured JSON‑lines plugin logging per run (src/elspeth/core/utils/logging.py).

## Material Risks / Conditions for Acceptance

1) Raise coverage to ≥85% overall; lift under‑tested hotspots (e.g., src/elspeth/core/base/types.py at 58%).
2) Add Bandit (and optionally Semgrep) to CI; fail on HIGH findings.
3) Validate HTTP LLM endpoints in the HttpOpenAIClient constructor (defense in depth) to complement registry‑level validation.
4) Enforce locked dependency installs in all paths; avoid unpinned pyproject installs outside pip‑tools sync.

## Snapshot of Evidence

- Tests: 744 passed, 1 skipped; coverage 82% overall (coverage.xml; pytest output).
- Supply chain: pip‑audit clean on requirements.lock; SBOM generated in CI.
- Reproducibility: CI uses pip‑tools sync with --require‑hashes; README documents locked installs.
- Secrets: Secret scan clean; historical note on expired SAS token now remediated and ignored (.gitignore, SECURITY.md).
- Observability: JSONL logs with plugin metadata and metrics; error paths log structured entries.

## Next Steps (Recommended Order)

1) Add endpoint validation to HttpOpenAIClient.__init__ (S).
2) Add Bandit to CI; publish SARIF and fail on HIGH (S).
3) Enforce lockfile installs across docs/Makefile; guard against bare installs (S).
4) Add parametrized tests to raise coverage ≥85% overall; ≥80% in core/base/types.py (M).

See detailed gates (readiness_gates.md), findings (findings.json), and the remediation plan (remediation_plan.md).

## Progress Since Initial Audit

- Implemented defense‑in‑depth validation in `HttpOpenAIClient` to enforce endpoint allowlisting even when instantiated directly (src/elspeth/plugins/nodes/transforms/llm/openai_http.py).
- Added Bandit scanning to CI (uploads SARIF artefact); ready to flip to fail on HIGH after baseline (.github/workflows/ci.yml).
- Enforced locked developer installs in README via `piptools sync` (README.md).
- Coverage uplift on critical hotspots via new tests:
  - `core/base/types.py` → 93% (aliases, comparisons, error branches).
  - `core/base/schema/inference.py` → 100%; `model_factory.py` → 94% (constraints and optionals).
  - Path safety utilities covered (resolve_under_base, symlink guards, atomic writes).
  - LLM registry negative paths (conflicting security levels, unapproved endpoints) covered.
  - Blob datasource success/skip‑on‑error paths covered.
  - Visual/Excel/CSV/ZIP sinks: skip‑on‑error and sanitization/containment paths covered.
  - Azure middleware (environment + Content Safety) request/response, retry‑exhausted, abort/mask/skip branches covered.
  - Reporting helpers and visualizations (skip path) covered.
- Current suite: 860+ tests passing locally (excl. 1 skipped integration). Overall coverage ~83% with branch coverage enabled; remaining high‑ROI tests identified to reach ≥85%.
