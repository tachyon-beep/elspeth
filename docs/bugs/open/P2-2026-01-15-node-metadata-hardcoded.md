# Bug Report: Config gate nodes use hardcoded metadata

## Summary
- ~~Orchestrator registers all nodes with `plugin_version="1.0.0"` and default determinism~~
- **UPDATE 2026-01-19:** Plugin nodes (source, transforms, sinks) now correctly extract metadata from plugin instances. Only **config gates** still use hardcoded `plugin_version="1.0.0"` since they are engine-internal expression evaluators without plugin instances.

## Severity
- Severity: minor (downgraded from major - only affects config gates)
- Priority: P2 (downgraded from P1)

## Reporter
- Name or handle: Codex
- Date: 2026-01-15

## Environment
- Commit/branch: 5c27593 (local)
- OS: Linux (dev env)
- Python version: 3.11+ (per project)
- Config profile / env vars: N/A
- Data set or fixture: N/A

## Agent Context (if applicable)
- Goal or task prompt: N/A
- Model/version: N/A
- Tooling and permissions (sandbox/approvals): N/A
- Determinism details (seed, run ID): N/A
- Notable tool calls or steps: N/A

## Steps To Reproduce
1. Configure a pipeline that includes at least one **config gate** (the `gates:` section).
2. Run the pipeline.
3. Inspect the `nodes` table for the run and locate the config gate node(s).

## Expected Behavior
- Config gate nodes should have clear, intentional metadata:
  - a deterministic determinism value (likely deterministic), and
  - a version scheme that reflects the engine/config gate evaluator version (not a hard-coded placeholder).

## Actual Behavior
- Config gate nodes use hardcoded `plugin_version="1.0.0"` and `determinism=DETERMINISTIC`, independent of any explicit versioning scheme.

## Evidence
- Config gates use hardcoded metadata at node registration time: `src/elspeth/engine/orchestrator.py:443-447`
- Recorder supports determinism and receives values from the orchestrator: `src/elspeth/engine/orchestrator.py:463-472`
- Config gate semantics are engine-internal (no plugin instance exists): `src/elspeth/core/dag.py:339-344`

## Impact
- User-facing impact: Audit records misrepresent plugin versions and determinism, undermining reproducibility and compliance.
- Data integrity / security impact: Reproducibility grade and audit trail integrity are compromised.
- Performance or cost impact: N/A.

## Root Cause Hypothesis
- Orchestrator builds nodes from graph info only and does not read plugin instance metadata (version/determinism/schema hashes).

## Proposed Fix
- Code changes (modules/files):
  - Treat plugin metadata as a first-class compile-time artifact, not a runtime patch:
    - `src/elspeth/plugins/manager.py`: expose a public helper or `PluginSpec.from_plugin(...)` for metadata resolution (version, determinism, schema hashes) so the CLI and engine share a single source of truth.
    - `src/elspeth/core/dag.py`: extend `NodeInfo` to carry `plugin_version`, `determinism`, and a stable `schema_hash` computed from input/output schema hashes; populate these in `ExecutionGraph.from_config(...)` using the plugin registry.
    - `src/elspeth/engine/orchestrator.py`: register nodes from `NodeInfo` (no hard-coded defaults), ensuring the audit trail matches the validated execution graph.
    - `src/elspeth/plugins/protocols.py` and `src/elspeth/plugins/base.py`: add `plugin_version` and `determinism` to `SourceProtocol`/`BaseSource` to avoid source nodes becoming an audit exception.
  - Avoid any runtime fallback or hard-coded values; if metadata is missing, fail fast during graph compilation.
- Config or schema changes: none.
- Tests to add/update:
  - Orchestrator test asserting `nodes.plugin_version`, `nodes.determinism`, and `nodes.schema_hash` match plugin class metadata for source, transform, gate, and sink.
  - Registry test to assert schema hash composition is stable and deterministic.
- Risks or migration steps:
  - Requires wiring a plugin registry into graph compilation; keep this as the single metadata resolution path.
  - Ensure adapters (e.g., `SinkAdapter`) surface plugin identity without masking the underlying plugin class metadata.

## Architectural Deviations
- Spec or doc reference (e.g., docs/design/architecture.md#L...): `docs/design/architecture.md:249` (audit trail captures plugin instances with metadata).
- Observed divergence: node records use hard-coded version and default determinism.
- Reason (if known): registration uses graph-only info without plugin metadata.
- Alignment plan or decision needed: define authoritative source for plugin metadata during node registration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Node records contain actual plugin version and determinism for source/transform/gate/sink nodes.

## Tests
- Suggested tests to run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/engine/test_orchestrator.py -k node`
- New tests required: yes (node metadata persistence).

## Partial Resolution

**Partially fixed in:** 2026-01-19 (verified during triage)

**What's fixed:**
- Plugin nodes (source, transforms, sinks) now correctly extract `plugin_version` and `determinism` from the plugin instance (`src/elspeth/engine/orchestrator.py:451-456`)

**What remains:**
- Config gates still use hardcoded `plugin_version="1.0.0"` (line 445)
- This may be acceptable since config gates are engine-internal expression evaluators, not user-facing plugins

**Recommendation:** Consider closing as "by design" - config gates don't have plugin instances and their behavior is deterministic by nature. Alternatively, define a version scheme for the config gate "pseudo-plugin".
