# ADR-006: Layer Dependency Remediation — Enforcing Strict 4-Layer Import Direction

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Architecture Critic (SME agent), Systems Thinking Analyst (SME agent), Python Code Reviewer (SME agent), Claude (synthesis/lead)
**Tags:** architecture, dependency-cycles, contracts, core, engine, layer-enforcement

## Context

ELSPETH has 4 intended layers with downward-only imports:

```
L0: contracts/  →  Type contracts, protocols, schemas (intended foundation)
L1: core/       →  Landscape audit, config, canonical JSON, security, DAG models
L2: engine/     →  Orchestrator, executors, retry, processor
L3: plugins/    →  Sources, transforms, sinks, clients
```

**This layering was never designed — it was emergent.** Packages were organized by topic ("contracts are about types", "core is about infrastructure") rather than by dependency direction ("contracts depends on nothing above it"). The `contracts/__init__.py` docstring claims "LEAF MODULE with no outbound dependencies to core/engine" — this has never been true.

### The Violations

10 runtime layer violations exist, all dating to the initial RC2 commit (`f4f348de`, 2026-02-02). Every one uses a lazy inline import with an apologetic comment:

**Cluster 1 — Canonical hashing (4 violations, MUTUAL CYCLE):**
- `contracts/plugin_context.py:359,441` → `core.canonical.stable_hash, repr_hash`
- `contracts/contract_records.py:138` → `core.canonical.canonical_json`
- `contracts/schema_contract.py:319` → `core.canonical.canonical_json`
- Reverse direction: `core/canonical.py` lazily imports `PipelineRow` from `contracts/schema_contract.py`

**Cluster 2 — URL/Secret handling (3 violations):**
- `contracts/url.py:109` → `core.config._sanitize_dsn` (imports a private function across layers)
- `contracts/url.py:188` → `core.config.SecretFingerprintError`
- `contracts/url.py:233` → `core.security.fingerprint.get_fingerprint_key, secret_fingerprint`

**Cluster 3 — Config (1 violation):**
- `contracts/config/runtime.py:318` → `core.config.ServiceRateLimit`

**Cluster 4 — Expression validation (3 violations):**
- `core/config.py:295,551,639` → `engine.expression_parser.ExpressionParser`

### Systemic Pattern: Shifting the Burden

A systems dynamics analysis identified this as a **"Shifting the Burden" archetype** (Senge, *The Fifth Discipline*). Each lazy import is a symptomatic fix that defers the structural solution:

```
New feature needs hashing     Developer adds lazy       Violation count
in contracts/            →    import workaround     →   increases
      ↑                                                      |
      |                                                      ↓
      |                                                Restructuring
      |                                                effort grows
      |                                                      |
      └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              "Just add another lazy import,
               restructuring is too big now"
```

The system was accumulating ~0.5 new violations per development-day. Without intervention, the window for cheap restructuring was closing.

### Key Findings from Code Analysis

1. **Canonical hashing is a mutual dependency cycle**, not just one-directional. `core/canonical.py` imports `PipelineRow` from contracts, while contracts imports `canonical_json`/`stable_hash` from canonical. Both sides lazy-import from each other.

2. **All contracts-side callers of `canonical_json` only hash plain dicts of primitives** (strings, bools, lists). They never pass PipelineRow, pandas, or numpy objects. This makes extraction clean.

3. **ExpressionParser has zero engine dependencies** — it's pure stdlib (`ast`, `operator`). It lives in `engine/` by topic, not by dependency.

4. **The fingerprint functions are stdlib-only** (`hashlib`, `hmac`, `os`). They're genuine primitives misplaced in `core/security/`.

5. **`_sanitize_dsn` is a private function** imported across layer boundaries — violating both the layer model and Python's convention that underscore-prefixed names are internal.

6. **`ServiceRateLimit` is a Settings-layer Pydantic model** leaking into the Runtime-layer, violating the established Settings→Runtime dataclass pattern.

## Decision

### Maintain Strict 4-Layer Model, Move Code to Match

We maintain the 4-layer hierarchy (contracts → core → engine → plugins) with strict downward-only imports. We relocate misplaced code to its correct layer rather than relaxing the model.

### Phase 1: Move ExpressionParser (eliminates 3 violations)

Move `engine/expression_parser.py` → `core/expression_parser.py`. Pure file move, zero logic changes. Convert 3 lazy imports in `core/config.py` to direct top-level imports.

**Rationale:** ExpressionParser is a security-focused AST validator for config expressions. It belongs in `core/` (L1). Its only dependencies are stdlib (`ast`, `operator`).

### Phase 2: Extract contracts/hashing.py (eliminates 4 violations + breaks circular dep)

1. Remove the `PipelineRow` isinstance check from `core/canonical.py`'s `_normalize_for_canonical()` (~3 lines). Callers already call `.to_dict()` before passing data.
2. Create `contracts/hashing.py` (~15 lines) with primitives-only versions of `canonical_json()`, `stable_hash()`, and `repr_hash()`. Dependencies: `rfc8785` (pure Python, zero transitive deps) + `hashlib` (stdlib).
3. `core/canonical.py` imports FROM `contracts/hashing.py` for the final RFC 8785 serialization step, after its pandas/numpy normalization pass.

**Rationale:** Contracts callers only hash plain dicts — they don't need pandas/numpy normalization. The split is along a clean interface boundary: primitives-only hashing (L0) vs. data-type normalization + hashing (L1).

### Phase 3: Move fingerprint primitives + rewrite DSN handling (eliminates 3 violations)

1. Create `contracts/security.py`. Move `SecretFingerprintError`, `get_fingerprint_key()`, and `secret_fingerprint()` from `core/` to `contracts/security.py`. These are stdlib-only primitives.
2. Replace `_sanitize_dsn` usage in `contracts/url.py` with direct `urllib.parse` implementation. The contracts type only needs password extraction + fingerprinting, not full SQLAlchemy URL normalization.

**Rationale:** Fingerprint functions have no ELSPETH dependencies — they're lower-level than `core/`. The DSN rewrite eliminates a cross-layer import of a private function.

### Phase 4: Add RuntimeServiceRateLimit (eliminates 1 violation)

Add a `RuntimeServiceRateLimit` frozen dataclass in `contracts/config/runtime.py`, following the established Settings→Runtime pattern. Remove the lazy import of `ServiceRateLimit` from `core/config.py`.

**Rationale:** Every other Runtime*Config type has its own dataclass. ServiceRateLimit was the only Settings-layer Pydantic model leaking into the Runtime-layer.

### Phase 5: Enforcement — CI Gate + Decision Protocol

After all violations are fixed:

1. **Strengthen `enforce_tier_model.py`** to fail CI on new upward imports. The allowlist mechanism already exists.
2. **Document the "Violation #11 Protocol"** in CLAUDE.md — a decision protocol for when the next developer needs something from a higher layer:
   - Move the needed code down (if it has no upward dependencies)
   - Extract the primitive portion and move that down
   - Restructure the caller so it doesn't need the cross-layer code
   - **Never** add a lazy import with an apologetic comment
3. **Update `contracts/__init__.py` docstring** to accurately reflect the enforced reality.

**Rationale:** The systems analysis showed that fixing violations without enforcement just resets the addiction loop. The protocol prevents the "Shifting the Burden" archetype from recurring.

### What We Are NOT Doing

1. **No new "primitives" layer.** Adding a 5th layer below contracts/ would create new boundary ambiguity. The systems analysis warned: "the system recreates boundary ambiguity at whatever new boundary you draw."
2. **No Protocol/Dependency Injection for hashing.** There's exactly one correct implementation of `canonical_json`. Protocol indirection adds cognitive overhead without flexibility benefit.
3. **No "foundation tier" model.** Accepting bidirectional deps between contracts and core creates a permission structure that erodes over time. Strict layering is harder to maintain but prevents the entropy.
4. **No re-exports for backward compatibility.** Per the no-legacy-code policy, moved code gets updated imports at all call sites in the same commit.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- `contracts/` becomes a genuine leaf module — testable and importable without pulling in core/engine/plugins
- Static analysis (mypy, import linting) catches layer violations at CI time, not runtime
- Cognitive load decreases — developers can trust the layer model instead of discovering hidden lazy imports
- The "Shifting the Burden" feedback loop is broken by both fixing the stock (10 violations → 0) and adding a balancing loop (CI enforcement)
- `core/canonical.py`'s circular dependency with contracts is severed, making both modules independently refactorable

### Negative Consequences

- ~30 files touched across all phases (mostly mechanical import path changes)
- Two implementations of canonical JSON exist: `contracts/hashing.py` (primitives only) and `core/canonical.py` (with pandas/numpy normalization). Callers must use the right one — but the type signatures make this unambiguous (`dict | list | str | int | float | bool | None` vs `Any`)
- The DSN rewrite in `contracts/url.py` introduces a second URL password-extraction implementation alongside `_sanitize_dsn` in `core/config.py`. Both are small (~30 lines) and the contracts version is simpler (stdlib only vs SQLAlchemy)
- CI enforcement adds friction when legitimate cross-layer needs arise — but the decision protocol provides a structured resolution path

### Neutral Consequences

- `core/canonical.py` shrinks slightly (PipelineRow check removed) and gains an import from `contracts/hashing.py` — dependency direction reverses from incorrect (contracts→core) to correct (core→contracts)
- `core/config.py` loses `SecretFingerprintError` and one validator's lazy import, slightly reducing its 1,600-line scope — directionally helpful for the separate config.py decomposition effort (T23)
- `enforce_tier_model.py` gains new detection capabilities but the allowlist mechanism already handles exceptions

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Foundation Tier Model (contracts + core as bidirectional peers)

**Description:** Redefine the layer model from strict 4-tier to "2-tier foundation + 2-tier application." Within the foundation tier (contracts + core), bidirectional dependencies are permitted. The strict boundary moves to foundation↔application (engine, plugins).

**Considered because:** The systems thinker proposed this as a Level 3 (goals) intervention — more honest about the empirical reality than the strict model.

**Rejected because:** It creates a permission structure that erodes over time. Once bidirectional deps are "allowed" within the foundation tier, every new cross-dependency between contracts and core gets justified as "it's all foundation." The Shifting the Burden archetype would shift one level up — from "lazy imports mask violations" to "foundation tier membership masks coupling growth." The strict model is harder to maintain but prevents the entropy.

### Alternative 2: Protocol/Dependency Injection for Hashing

**Description:** Define a `CanonicalHasher` protocol in contracts/, implement in core/. Inject the hasher at construction time rather than importing directly.

**Considered because:** The Python engineer evaluated this as a standard dependency inversion technique.

**Rejected because:** There's exactly one correct implementation of `canonical_json`. Protocol indirection adds boilerplate (protocol definition, injection plumbing, test mocking) without any flexibility benefit. The contracts-side callers don't need polymorphism — they need a deterministic hash of a dict. Direct function call is simpler and equally correct.

### Alternative 3: New "Primitives" Layer Below Contracts

**Description:** Create a new L-1 package (`elspeth.primitives` or `elspeth.foundations`) containing dependency-free utilities: hashing, fingerprinting, canonical JSON.

**Considered because:** Both the architecture critic and Python engineer considered this in their initial analysis.

**Rejected because:** The systems thinker identified this as a structural trap. Adding a new boundary creates new ambiguity ("should this go in primitives or contracts?"). History shows the system recreates the same Shifting the Burden dynamic at whatever boundary is drawn. Only `repr_hash` (3 lines, pure stdlib) truly qualifies as a "primitive" — the rest needs `rfc8785` at minimum. A 5th layer for 3 lines of code is not justified.

### Alternative 4: Defer — Keep Lazy Imports, Fix Later

**Description:** Accept the lazy imports as "messy but functional" and prioritize feature work.

**Considered because:** The violations cause no runtime errors. The lazy imports work.

**Rejected because:** The systems analysis showed this IS the symptomatic solution driving the Shifting the Burden loop. The restructuring effort was estimated at ~1 developer-day at time of analysis. Each additional violation increases this cost. The window for cheap restructuring was closing — estimated at ~30 days before the stock of violations would exceed the "prioritizable against feature work" threshold. ELSPETH has no external users, so breaking changes are free. There will never be a better time.

## Notes

### Verification Criteria for Completion

After all 5 phases:
- `grep -rn 'from elspeth.core' src/elspeth/contracts/` returns 0 results (excluding TYPE_CHECKING blocks)
- `grep -rn 'from elspeth.engine' src/elspeth/core/` returns 0 results (excluding TYPE_CHECKING blocks)
- `enforce_tier_model.py` CI gate passes with no allowlist entries for layer violations
- `contracts/__init__.py` docstring accurately states "leaf module with no runtime dependencies on core/engine/plugins"
- All 8,000+ tests pass
- mypy passes with no new `# type: ignore` additions

### Implementation Ordering

The phases must be executed in dependency order within each cluster, but clusters are independent:

```
Phase 1 (ExpressionParser) ─────────────────────────┐
Phase 2 (contracts/hashing.py) ─────────────────────┤
Phase 3 (fingerprint + DSN) ────────────────────────┼──► Phase 5 (CI enforcement)
Phase 4 (RuntimeServiceRateLimit) ──────────────────┘
```

Phases 1-4 have no inter-dependencies and can be parallelized. Phase 5 must wait for all 4.

### Interaction with Other RC3.3 Work

- **088f8b (Phase 2) and T17 (PluginContext split)** both touch `contracts/plugin_context.py`. Phase 2 should complete first (it's Phase 1 priority; T17 is Phase 3).
- **Phase 3 and T23 (config.py decomposition)** — Phase 3 removes code from config.py. T23 splits what remains. Dependency is wired: T23 depends on Phase 3 completion.
- **Phase 2 step 1 (remove PipelineRow check)** — verify no callers pass PipelineRow directly to `canonical_json()` without `.to_dict()`. Contracts callers confirmed clean; check engine/core callers during implementation.
