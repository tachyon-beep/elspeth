## ADR-002 Implementation Summary

### What Was Delivered

**ADR-002: Multi-Level Security Enforcement**
- Suite-level minimum security clearance envelope
- Start-time validation (fail-fast before data access)
- Runtime failsafe (defense-in-depth at data hand-off)
- Classification uplifting (high water mark principle)

**ADR-002-A: Trusted Container Model**
- `ClassifiedDataFrame` with immutable classification metadata
- Constructor protection (datasource-only creation)
- Automatic uplifting (`with_uplifted_classification()`)
- Access validation (`validate_access_by()`)

**Security Fixes**:
- CVE-ADR-002-A-001: Frame equality bypass in `__post_init__`
- CVE-ADR-002-A-002: `_created_by_datasource` parameter bypass

### Test Coverage

- **72 passing tests** (invariants, performance, integration)
- **6 security invariants** verified (constructor protection, uplifting, immutability, access validation)
- **Performance validated**: <0.1ms overhead per suite
- **100% coverage** on critical security paths

### Threat Mitigation

| Threat | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **T1: Classification Breach** | Start-time + runtime validation | ✅ Mitigated |
| **T2: LLM Prompt Leakage** | Middleware security filters | ✅ Mitigated |
| **T3: Runtime Bypass** | Dual-layer validation (start + runtime) | ✅ Mitigated |
| **T4: Classification Mislabeling** | Constructor protection, uplifting | ✅ Mitigated |
| **T5: Sink Misconfiguration** | Security level enforcement | ✅ Mitigated |
| **T6: Accidental Downgrade** | Immutable classification, max() operation | ✅ Mitigated |

## Next Steps (ADR-003/ADR-004)

ADR-002 implementation is **complete**. The next phase is:

1. **ADR-003**: Central Plugin Type Registry for Security Validation
   - Planning: `docs/architecture/decisions/003-plugin-type-registry.md`
   - Migration: `docs/migration/adr-003-004-classified-containers/`

2. **ADR-004**: Mandatory BasePlugin Inheritance (Nominal Typing)
   - Planning: `docs/architecture/decisions/004-mandatory-baseplugin-inheritance.md`

3. **Container Migration**: Universal adoption of `ClassifiedDataFrame`
   - Migration Plan: `docs/migration/adr-003-004-classified-containers/INTEGRATED_ROADMAP.md`
   - Estimated Effort: 30-40 hours (4-5 days)

## Purpose of This Archive

**Why Preserve These Documents?**

1. **Audit Trail**: Demonstrates systematic implementation process for compliance reviews
2. **Lessons Learned**: Documents decision-making process and evolution of design
3. **Historical Reference**: Shows original planning estimates vs actual implementation
4. **Methodology Example**: Can be used as template for future ADR implementations

**Do Not Modify**: These documents are read-only historical snapshots
