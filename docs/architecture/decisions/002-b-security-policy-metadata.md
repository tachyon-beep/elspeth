## Context

### Problem Statement

[ADR-002: Multi-Level Security Enforcement](002-security-architecture.md) establishes a Bell-LaPadula Multi-Level Security (MLS) model with fail-fast enforcement through plugin clearance validation and data classification immutability. [ADR-005: Frozen Plugin Capability](005-frozen-plugin-capability.md) introduces explicit downgrade policy control (`allow_downgrade` flag) to distinguish between:

- **Trusted downgrade plugins** (`allow_downgrade=True`): Higher-clearance plugins certified to operate at lower levels by filtering data appropriately
- **Frozen plugins** (`allow_downgrade=False`): Strict enforcement – plugin must operate at exact declared level

During Phase 2 migration to the central plugin registry architecture (ADR-003), we discovered that leaving security policy metadata (`security_level`, `allow_downgrade`) configurable by operators via YAML configuration creates a **configuration-driven security bypass vulnerability** that silently undermines the certification and attestation model established by ADR-002 and ADR-005.

### Regulatory Context

**Australian Government Requirements**:
- **ISM Control**: ISM-0037 (Classification and Sensitivity) – Information must be classified according to its sensitivity and handled appropriately, with classifications not arbitrarily changeable
- **ISM Control**: ISM-0380 (Access Control) – Access to systems and data must be based on valid security clearances determined through certification processes
- **ISM Control**: ISM-1084 (Event Logging) – Security-relevant events must be logged with sufficient detail for audit and incident investigation
- **ISM Control**: ISM-1433 (Error Handling) – Security errors must trigger fail-closed behaviour (abort execution, not degrade security posture)
- **PSPF Policy**: Policy 8 (Sensitive and Classified Information) – Security controls must be technically enforced, not merely procedural

**IRAP Assessment Evidence**: This ADR provides technical control evidence demonstrating:
- Security policy immutability (configuration cannot override certified clearance levels)
- Certification attestation integrity (deployed behaviour matches certified policy)
- Defence-in-depth enforcement (three independent validation layers)
- Fail-fast configuration validation (misconfigured security policy detected at registration time)

### Attack Scenario: Configuration-Driven Security Bypass

**Threat Model Context**: ADR-002 establishes fail-fast security validation to prevent misconfigured pipelines from loading classified data into memory. ADR-005 introduces frozen plugins for high-assurance environments requiring strict level enforcement. This ADR addresses **Threat T5: Configuration-Driven Policy Override** – attackers or operators bypassing security controls through YAML configuration changes.

**Configuration Error/Attack Pattern**:

```yaml
# config/experiments/audit_review.yaml
datasource:
  type: "azure_blob_secret_datasource"
  container: "classified-government-data"
  security_level: "UNOFFICIAL"      # ← Override from certified SECRET to UNOFFICIAL
  allow_downgrade: true             # ← Enable downgrade for certified frozen plugin

sinks:
  - type: "public_csv_export"
    path: "outputs/public_report.csv"
    security_level: "UNOFFICIAL"
```

**Without ADR-002-B (Vulnerable Configuration Path)**:

1. **Plugin Certification** (Pre-Deployment):
   - Plugin author declares `security_level=SECRET`, `allow_downgrade=False` in code
   - Security team reviews code and certifies plugin as "SECRET-only, frozen"
   - Manifest signed: `{"security_level": "SECRET", "allow_downgrade": false}`

2. **Registry Accepts Configuration Override** (Deployment):
   - Operator provides YAML with `security_level: UNOFFICIAL`, `allow_downgrade: true`
   - Registry treats security policy as "just another config parameter"
   - Plugin factory passes YAML values to `BasePlugin.__init__()`
   - **Result**: Plugin instantiated with UNOFFICIAL clearance, downgrade enabled

3. **Pipeline Construction** (Runtime):
   - Operating level computation: `min(UNOFFICIAL datasource, UNOFFICIAL sink) = UNOFFICIAL`
   - Clearance validation passes: UNOFFICIAL datasource can operate at UNOFFICIAL level
   - **Security breach**: Frozen SECRET plugin now operates as UNOFFICIAL with downgrade enabled

4. **Data Retrieval and Leakage**:
   - Datasource operates at UNOFFICIAL level (trusted downgrade enabled via config)
   - Datasource retrieves ALL blobs (no filtering – plugin wasn't certified for multi-level operation)
   - SECRET-classified data loaded into UNOFFICIAL pipeline
   - Data written to public CSV sink
   - **Outcome**: Classification bypass via configuration override

**Security Impact Analysis**:

| Property | Without ADR-002-B | With ADR-002-B |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Certification Integrity** | Violated – certified policy ≠ runtime policy | Enforced – runtime policy matches certified code |
| **ISM-0037 Compliance** | Non-compliant – classification arbitrarily changed via config | Compliant – classification immutable after certification |
| **ISM-0380 Compliance** | Non-compliant – clearance override bypasses access control | Compliant – clearance determined by certification only |
| **ADR-005 Frozen Plugin** | Bypassable – `allow_downgrade=False` overridden to `true` | Enforced – frozen policy cannot be changed via config |
| **Attack Surface** | All deployed configurations (operator error or malicious modification) | Zero – registry rejects misconfigured deployments at load time |
| **Detection** | Silent bypass (no validation error, logs show UNOFFICIAL operation) | Immediate failure with `ConfigurationError` at registration |
| **Audit Trail** | Gap between manifest signature and runtime behaviour | Consistent – manifest, code, and runtime policy aligned |

**Why This is Critical**: The vulnerability allows **silent security degradation** without triggering any ADR-002 fail-fast validations. The pipeline construction validation passes (UNOFFICIAL → UNOFFICIAL clearance check succeeds) but the **semantic security intent** is violated (SECRET frozen plugin operating as UNOFFICIAL non-frozen plugin). This undermines the entire certification and attestation model.

**ISM Control Violation Mapping**:
- **ISM-0037**: Classification arbitrarily downgraded from SECRET to UNOFFICIAL via configuration
- **ISM-0380**: Access control bypassed (plugin without certified UNOFFICIAL filtering retrieves SECRET data)
- **ISM-1084**: No audit event for policy override (silent degradation)
- **ISM-1433**: Security error (misconfiguration) does not abort execution (fails open, not closed)

**With ADR-002-B (Three-Layer Defence)**:

1. **Registry Validation** (Load Time):
   - Layer 2 enforcement detects security policy override in configuration
   - Registry rejects registration with `ConfigurationError`:
     ```
     Configuration exposes forbidden security policy fields: {'security_level', 'allow_downgrade'}.
     These are plugin-author-owned and immutable (ADR-002-B). Remove from YAML and accept
     plugin's declared policy.
     ```
   - **Pipeline construction never occurs** – fail-fast at configuration load time

2. **Fail-Fast Benefits**:
   - ✅ Misconfiguration detected immediately (no data retrieval window)
   - ✅ Clear operator guidance (error message explains ADR-002-B requirement)
   - ✅ Audit trail integrity (attempted override logged)
   - ✅ Certification alignment (runtime policy matches certified code)
   - ✅ ISM-1433 compliance (fails closed on configuration error)

**Attack Flow Comparison**:

```
WITHOUT ADR-002-B (Vulnerable):
YAML config override → Registry accepts → Plugin instantiated with wrong policy →
Pipeline construction succeeds → Data retrieval → SILENT BREACH

WITH ADR-002-B (Secure):
YAML config override → Registry detects violation → ConfigurationError raised →
Pipeline construction never occurs → FAIL-FAST, ZERO EXPOSURE
```

### Root Cause: Dual-Purpose Security Policy Metadata

Security policy metadata (`security_level`, `allow_downgrade`, future `max_operating_level`) serves two architecturally conflicting purposes in the plugin model:

**Purpose 1: Construction Parameter** (Implementation Concern)
- Required by `BasePlugin.__init__()` constructor (ADR-004 enforcement foundation)
- Passed during plugin instantiation to configure security behaviour
- Necessary for plugin object creation

**Purpose 2: Security Attestation** (Certification Concern)
- Declared by plugin author as immutable security capability assertion
- Reviewed by security team during certification process
- Signed in reproducibility bundle manifests (ADR-014 attestation)
- Audited by IRAP assessors for compliance evidence

Treating these fields as "regular configuration parameters" accessible via YAML configuration creates a **semantic mismatch**: operators can change **attestation metadata** (what security level was certified?) through **configuration syntax** (deployment-specific tuning parameters), fundamentally undermining the trust model.

**Analogous Vulnerability Pattern**:

This is similar to allowing TLS/SSL certificate validation level to be configurable per deployment:
```python
# ❌ INSECURE: Operator can disable certificate validation
https_client = HTTPSClient(
    endpoint="https://classified.gov.au",
    verify_certificates=False  # ← Configuration override defeats security control
)
```

The security control (`verify_certificates`) should be **code-declared and immutable**, not **operator-configurable**. ADR-002-B applies the same principle to MLS clearance levels and downgrade policies.

### Current Defence Gaps (Pre-ADR-002-B)

**Layer 1 (ADR-002)**: Plugin clearance validation occurs **after** instantiation, validating the plugin's `get_security_level()` return value. If configuration overrides the constructor parameter, the overridden value is validated (correct validation of wrong policy).

**Layer 2 (ADR-002-A)**: SecureDataFrame immutability prevents **data classification** downgrade but does not prevent **plugin clearance** override via configuration (orthogonal security properties).

**Layer 3 (ADR-005)**: Frozen plugin behaviour depends on `allow_downgrade` flag being correctly set. Configuration override defeats the entire frozen plugin security model.

**Defence Gap**: No enforcement layer prevents operators from overriding security policy metadata through configuration. The certification process validates **code-declared policy**, but runtime uses **config-declared policy** if provided, creating a **time-of-certification to time-of-deployment** (TOCTOD) vulnerability.

## Decision

We will adopt **Immutable Security Policy Metadata** enforced through a **three-layer defence-in-depth architecture** that prevents security policy from being overridden via configuration, ensuring runtime behaviour matches certified code declarations.

### Architectural Principle: Policy Ownership Separation

**Plugin-Author-Owned Fields** (Immutable, Code-Declared, Certification-Bound):
- `security_level: SecurityLevel` – Plugin's maximum security clearance (ADR-002)
- `allow_downgrade: bool` – Downgrade permission flag (ADR-005)
- `max_operating_level: SecurityLevel` – Future: Upper bound on operating levels (reserved)
- Any field controlling Bell-LaPadula MLS enforcement behaviour

**Operator-Owned Fields** (Mutable, YAML-Configurable, Deployment-Specific):
- `path: str`, `container: str`, `endpoint: str` – Data source locations
- `batch_size: int`, `timeout: int`, `retry_count: int` – Performance tuning
- `format: str`, `encoding: str`, `compression: str` – Data handling options
- Business logic parameters (thresholds, filters, feature flags)

**Separation Rationale**: Security policy is a **property of the plugin implementation** validated during certification, not a **deployment configuration parameter** varied per environment. Operators choose **which plugin** to use (selection), not **how secure that plugin behaves** (policy).

**Analogy**: Operators cannot change a TLS library's cipher suite strength via configuration; they select the library version certified for their required security level. Similarly, operators select plugins certified for their required clearance level.

### Implementation: Four-Layer Defence-in-Depth

#### Layer 0: Configuration-Layer Rejection (VULN-014 Cleanup)

**Purpose**: Fail-fast rejection of `security_level` in YAML configuration at load time, before plugin instantiation.

**Mechanism**: Configuration loader (`src/elspeth/config.py`) explicitly rejects any plugin definition containing `security_level` in either the definition or options dict.

**Implementation**: Added during VULN-014 cleanup (removal of orphaned security-level extraction code).

```python
# src/elspeth/config.py:_prepare_plugin_definition()

def _prepare_plugin_definition(definition: Mapping[str, Any], context: str):
    """Extract options, determinism level, and provenance.
    
    ADR-002-B: security_level is plugin-author-owned (hard-coded in constructors).
    Configuration MUST NOT specify security_level - it will be REJECTED.
    """
    
    # ADR-002-B: REJECT security_level in configuration (plugin-author-owned)
    entry_sec = definition.get("security_level")
    opts_sec = options.get("security_level")
    if entry_sec is not None or opts_sec is not None:
        raise ConfigurationError(
            f"{context}: security_level cannot be specified in configuration (ADR-002-B). "
            "Security level is plugin-author-owned and hard-coded in plugin constructors. "
            "See docs/architecture/decisions/002-b-security-policy-metadata.md"
        )
```

**Example – Invalid Configuration (Rejected)**:

```yaml
# config/settings.yaml
datasource:
  plugin: local_csv
  security_level: SECRET  # ❌ REJECTED at config load time
  options:
    path: data.csv

llm:
  plugin: azure_openai
  options:
    security_level: PROTECTED  # ❌ REJECTED at config load time
```

**Error Message**:
```
ConfigurationError: datasource: security_level cannot be specified in configuration (ADR-002-B).
Security level is plugin-author-owned and hard-coded in plugin constructors.
See docs/architecture/decisions/002-b-security-policy-metadata.md
```

**ISM Control**: ISM-1433 (Error Handling) – Fail-closed behaviour prevents misconfigured pipelines from executing

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Fastest possible failure (config load time, before plugin instantiation)
- ✅ Clear error message guides users to ADR-002-B documentation
- ✅ Prevents confusion from orphaned extraction code that silently ignored config
- ✅ Regression tests ensure rejection cannot be bypassed

**Test Coverage**: `tests/test_adr002b_config_enforcement.py` – 5 tests covering datasource/llm/sink rejection

#### Layer 1: Schema Enforcement with `additionalProperties: false`

**Purpose**: Prevent security policy fields from appearing in plugin configuration schemas at registration time.

**Mechanism**: All plugin configuration schemas MUST set `additionalProperties: false` and MUST NOT include security policy fields in `properties` section.

**Example – Compliant Schema**:

```python
# src/elspeth/plugins/nodes/sources/azure_blob.py

AZURE_BLOB_SCHEMA = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "container": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Azure Blob Storage container name"
        },
        "account_url": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "uri",
            "description": "Azure storage account URL"
        },
        "credential_type": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["default", "managed_identity", "service_principal"],
            "description": "Azure authentication credential type"
        }
        # ✅ NO security_level field (ADR-002-B compliant)
        # ✅ NO allow_downgrade field (ADR-002-B compliant)
    },
    "required": ["container", "account_url"],
    "additionalProperties": false  # ✅ Strict validation – rejects unknown fields
}
```

**Example – Non-Compliant Schema (Rejected)**:

```python
# ❌ FORBIDDEN PATTERN (Registry rejects at registration)

INSECURE_SCHEMA = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "container": {"type": "string"},
        "security_level": {"type": "string", "enum": ["UNOFFICIAL", "OFFICIAL", "SECRET"]},  # ❌ FORBIDDEN
        "allow_downgrade": {"type": "boolean"}  # ❌ FORBIDDEN
    },
    "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Enforcement Point**: JSONSchema validation rejects configuration with `security_level` or `allow_downgrade` fields:
```
ValidationError: Additional properties are not allowed ('security_level', 'allow_downgrade' were unexpected)
```

**ISM Control**: ISM-0037 (Classification and Sensitivity) – Schema enforcement prevents classification metadata from being configuration-driven

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Cannot detect if operator provides fields without schema validation
- ❌ Cannot detect if plugin accepts `**kwargs` and silently consumes forbidden fields
- ✅ Provides first line of defence (90% of configuration errors caught here)

#### Layer 2: Registry Runtime Rejection

**Purpose**: Validate that plugins **do not consume** security policy fields from configuration, even if passed.

**Mechanism**: Registry validates plugin instances post-creation to ensure declared security level matches actual security level, detecting silent consumption of configuration overrides.

**Implementation Location**: `src/elspeth/core/registries/base.py:131-177`

```python
# src/elspeth/core/registries/base.py (excerpt)

    self,
    options: dict[str, Any],
    *,
    plugin_context: PluginContext,
    schema_context: str,
) -> T:

    This method implements three-layer validation:

    3. Post-creation verification (Layer 2: verify declared vs actual security_level)

    Args:
        options: Plugin configuration options (YAML-provided)
        plugin_context: Security and provenance context
        schema_context: Context string for validation errors

    Raises:
        ConfigurationError: If validation fails or security policy mismatch detected
    """
    self.validate(options, context=schema_context)
    plugin = self.create(options, plugin_context)

    # Layer 2: Post-creation verification (ADR-002-B, VULN-004)
    if self.declared_security_level is not None:
        # Only verify if plugin has security_level attribute
        if hasattr(plugin, "security_level"):
            actual_security_level = plugin.security_level

            # SECURITY VALIDATION: Enforce SecurityLevel enum (ADR-002-B immutable policy)
            from elspeth.core.base.types import SecurityLevel

            if not isinstance(actual_security_level, SecurityLevel):
                # Plugin returns string or other type instead of SecurityLevel enum

                    f"ALL plugins MUST return SecurityLevel enum instance. "
                    f"Update plugin to use SecurityLevel.{str(actual_security_level).upper()} instead."
                )

            # Verify declared security level matches actual
            if self.declared_security_level != actual_security_level:
                raise ConfigurationError(
                    f"SECURITY POLICY VIOLATION (ADR-002-B): Plugin {type(plugin).__name__} "
                    f"declares security_level={self.declared_security_level.name} in registry "
                    f"but returns security_level={actual_security_level.name} at runtime. "
                    f"This indicates configuration override or plugin misbehaviour. "
                    f"Security policy MUST be code-declared and immutable. "
                    f"Remove 'security_level' from YAML configuration."
                )

    return plugin
```

**Enforcement Properties**:
- ✅ **Post-creation verification**: Validates plugin after instantiation (detects silent consumption)
- ✅ **Declared vs actual comparison**: Compares registry-declared level to plugin's `get_security_level()` return
- ✅ **Enum type enforcement**: Validates `SecurityLevel` enum (rejects string/int bypass attempts)
- ✅ **Fail-fast on mismatch**: Raises `ConfigurationError` before pipeline construction
- ✅ **Clear operator guidance**: Error message explains ADR-002-B requirement and remediation

**Detection Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Configuration Override Detected**
```python
# Registry declaration
registry.register(
    "azure_blob_secret",
    AzureBlobDataSource,
    declared_security_level=SecurityLevel.SECRET  # ← Registry records certification
)

# Operator config (YAML)
datasource:
  type: "azure_blob_secret"
  security_level: "UNOFFICIAL"  # ← Operator attempts override

# Layer 2 detection
# Plugin instantiated with UNOFFICIAL (configuration consumed)
# actual_security_level = SecurityLevel.UNOFFICIAL
# declared_security_level = SecurityLevel.SECRET
# Mismatch detected → ConfigurationError raised
```

**Scenario 2: Plugin Misbehaviour Detected**
```python
# Plugin ignores declared_security_level and uses hardcoded value
class MisbehavingPlugin(BasePlugin):
    def __init__(self, security_level: SecurityLevel):
        # BUG: Ignores parameter, always uses OFFICIAL
        super().__init__(security_level=SecurityLevel.OFFICIAL, allow_downgrade=True)

# Layer 2 detection
# declared_security_level = SecurityLevel.SECRET (registry)
# actual_security_level = SecurityLevel.OFFICIAL (plugin hardcoded)
# Mismatch detected → ConfigurationError raised
```

**ISM Control**: ISM-0380 (Access Control) – Runtime verification ensures clearance validation operates on certified levels, not configuration-overridden levels

**ISM Control**: ISM-1084 (Event Logging) – Security policy mismatches logged with declared vs actual levels for audit investigation

#### Layer 3: Factory Method Stripping (Belt-and-Suspenders)

**Purpose**: Ensure plugin factories do not pass security policy fields to plugin constructors, even if present in configuration.

**Mechanism**: Plugin factory methods explicitly strip security policy fields from operator-provided configuration before instantiation.

**Implementation Pattern**:

```python

    """Datasource reading from Azure Blob Storage with certified SECRET clearance.

**Defence-in-Depth Benefits**:
- ✅ **Belt-and-suspenders protection**: Even if Layers 1 and 2 fail, Layer 3 strips overrides
- ✅ **Explicit policy declaration**: Code comments document security policy and certification details
- ✅ **Centralized field inventory**: `FORBIDDEN_CONFIG_FIELDS` maintained in single location (`BasePluginRegistry`)
- ✅ **Migration safety**: Legacy configurations with forbidden fields are silently cleaned (graceful degradation)

**ISM Control**: ISM-1433 (Error Handling) – Factory method ensures secure default (code-declared policy) even if configuration contains errors

### Defence-in-Depth Summary

**Why Three Layers?**

Each layer provides **independent enforcement** compensating for limitations in other layers:

| Layer | Enforcement Mechanism | When Active | What It Prevents | Failure Mode |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Layer 1: Schema** | JSONSchema `additionalProperties: false` | Configuration load (YAML parsing) | Forbidden fields in schema | Operators can skip schema validation |
| **Layer 2: Registry** | Post-creation declared vs actual comparison | Plugin instantiation | Silent consumption of overrides | Requires registry declaration |
| **Layer 3: Factory** | Explicit field stripping | Plugin construction | Direct passing of forbidden fields | Requires factory discipline |

**Attack Resistance**:

| Attack Vector | Layer 1 | Layer 2 | Layer 3 | Result |
|--------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| **YAML config override** | ✅ Blocked | ✅ Detected | ✅ Stripped | **3x defence** |
| **Schema without `additionalProperties: false`** | ❌ Bypassed | ✅ Detected | ✅ Stripped | **2x defence** |
| **Plugin accepts `**kwargs`** | ❌ Bypassed | ✅ Detected | ✅ Stripped | **2x defence** |
| **Factory passes forbidden fields** | ❌ Bypassed | ✅ Detected | ❌ Bypassed | **1x defence** (sufficient) |
| **Registry registration without declaration** | ❌ Bypassed | ❌ Bypassed | ✅ Stripped | **1x defence** (sufficient) |

**Critical Security Property**: At least **one layer** catches every attack vector. Most attacks caught by **two or three layers** (redundant protection).

**ISM Control**: ISM-0039 (Defence-in-Depth) – Multiple independent security controls provide layered protection against configuration-driven policy bypass

### Manifest Attestation and Certification Integration

**Certification Workflow Integration**:

1. **Pre-Certification** (Plugin Development):
   - Plugin author declares `security_level` and `allow_downgrade` in code
   - Author documents filtering logic, threat model, supported operating levels
   - Author writes certification tests demonstrating correct behaviour at all levels

2. **Certification Review** (Security Team):
   - Reviewer validates code-declared security policy matches implementation
   - Reviewer verifies filtering logic correctness (for trusted downgrade plugins)
   - Reviewer confirms no configuration override paths exist
   - Reviewer signs attestation statement with certification scope and date

3. **Manifest Generation** (Build Process):
   - Build system extracts security policy from plugin code (not configuration)
   - Security policy metadata included in manifest `security_policy` section
   - Manifest signed with RSA-PSS or ECDSA signature (tamper-evident)
   - Code hash computed over plugin implementation (change detection)

4. **Deployment Validation** (Runtime):
   - Registry loads manifest and records `declared_security_level`
   - Layer 2 enforcement compares manifest declaration to plugin instance
   - Mismatch detection triggers `ConfigurationError` (fail-fast)
   - Audit log records security policy enforcement result

**ISM Control**: ISM-0037, ISM-0380, ISM-1084 – Manifest attestation provides end-to-end audit trail from certification to deployment, with technical enforcement at each stage

## Consequences

### Benefits

**Security Benefits**:

1. **Configuration-Driven Security Bypass Prevention** ✅
   - Operators cannot override `security_level` or `allow_downgrade` via YAML configuration
   - Resolves Phase 2 regression where frozen plugins (`allow_downgrade=False`) became unfrozen via config
   - Prevents silent security degradation (misconfigured policy triggers immediate `ConfigurationError`)
   - Eliminates TOCTOD (Time-of-Certification to Time-of-Deployment) vulnerability
   - **ISM Control**: ISM-0037 (Classification and Sensitivity) – Classification metadata immutable after certification
   - **ISM Control**: ISM-0380 (Access Control) – Clearance levels determined by certification, not configuration

2. **Certification and Attestation Integrity** ✅
   - Reproducibility bundle manifest signatures accurately reflect runtime security posture
   - Auditors can trust that certified `security_level` matches deployed behaviour
   - No gap between "certified policy" (code review) and "runtime policy" (configuration)
   - Supports IRAP assessment evidence requirements (consistent policy across deployment lifecycle)
   - **ISM Control**: ISM-1084 (Event Logging) – Security policy mismatches logged with full context for audit

3. **Clear Separation of Concerns** ✅
   - **Plugin Authors**: Declare security policy in code (`security_level`, `allow_downgrade`)
   - **Security Certifiers**: Audit code-declared policy, not deployment configurations
   - **Operators**: Configure behaviour in YAML (paths, endpoints, performance tuning)
   - **Deployment Managers**: Select plugins based on certified security policy, cannot modify policy
   - Aligns with ADR-001 principle: "Security is a non-negotiable constraint, not an operator choice"

4. **Defence-in-Depth Architecture** ✅
   - Three independent enforcement layers provide redundant protection:
     - **Layer 1 (Schema)**: Rejects forbidden fields at configuration load time
     - **Layer 2 (Registry)**: Detects silent consumption via post-creation verification
     - **Layer 3 (Factory)**: Strips forbidden fields as belt-and-suspenders protection
   - Each layer compensates for limitations in other layers
   - Attack resistance: Most attacks caught by 2-3 layers simultaneously
   - **ISM Control**: ISM-0039 (Defence-in-Depth) – Multiple security controls for layered protection

5. **Fail-Fast Configuration Validation** ✅
   - Security policy mismatches detected at registration time (before pipeline construction)
   - Clear error messages guide operators to correct configuration
   - Audit trail records all attempted policy overrides (forensic evidence)
   - Aligns with ADR-001 fail-closed principle (misconfiguration aborts deployment)
   - **ISM Control**: ISM-1433 (Error Handling) – Security errors trigger fail-closed behaviour

6. **Regulatory Compliance Alignment** ✅
   - Supports NIST SP 800-53 CM-2 (Baseline Configuration) – security policy is part of baseline, not deployment variation
   - Supports change control requirements – policy changes require code review + re-certification
   - Audit trail in Git history (policy changes visible in version control, not operator YAML edits)
   - IRAP assessment evidence – technical controls demonstrate policy immutability

**Operational Benefits**:

7. **Reduced Operational Risk** ✅
   - Eliminates entire class of operator errors (accidental policy override)
   - Prevents "works in dev, fails in prod" scenarios from security policy mismatches
   - Deployment validation catches configuration errors early (fail-fast at load time)
   - Lower incident response costs (configuration errors caught before production)

8. **Simplified Certification Burden** ✅
   - Certifiers only review code-declared policy (not deployment configurations)
   - No need to audit every deployment for configuration overrides
   - Re-certification triggered by code changes only (not configuration changes)
   - Certification evidence reusable across all deployments of same plugin version

9. **Clear Audit Trail** ✅
   - Security policy changes tracked in Git history (code commits)
   - Manifest signatures attest to policy at build time
   - Registry validation logs verify policy at deployment time
   - End-to-end traceability from certification to runtime
   - Supports forensic analysis and incident investigation

### Limitations and Trade-offs

**Governance and Operational Constraints**:

1. **Reduced Per-Environment Flexibility** ⚠️
   - **Limitation**: Cannot adjust `security_level` per environment (dev vs staging vs prod) via configuration
   - **Impact**: Cannot deploy same plugin code with different security levels (requires separate plugin classes)
   - **Rationale**: This is **by design** – security policy is a property of plugin implementation validated during certification, not a deployment tuning parameter
   - **Mitigation Strategy**:
     ```python
     # Create separate plugin classes for different security postures
     class DevAzureDatasource(BasePlugin):  # For development environments
         def __init__(self, **kwargs):
             super().__init__(security_level=SecurityLevel.UNOFFICIAL, allow_downgrade=True)
             # ... dev-specific implementation ...

     class ProdAzureDatasource(BasePlugin):  # For production environments
         def __init__(self, **kwargs):
             super().__init__(security_level=SecurityLevel.SECRET, allow_downgrade=False)
             # ... production-specific implementation ...
     ```
   - **Alternative**: Use feature flags or conditional logic within single plugin (but both code paths require certification)
   - **ISM Alignment**: Separate plugins per security level aligns with ISM-0380 (clearance-based access control)

2. **Breaking Change for Existing Configurations** ⚠️
   - **Impact**: Existing YAML configurations with `security_level` or `allow_downgrade` fields will fail at load time
   - **Detection**: Registry Layer 1 raises `ValidationError` (schema) or Layer 2 raises `ConfigurationError` (runtime verification)
   - **Migration Path**:
     1. **Scan**: Identify affected configurations using `grep -r "security_level:" config/`
     2. **Fix**: Remove `security_level` and `allow_downgrade` from YAML files
     3. **Verify**: Run `python -m elspeth.cli validate-schemas` to confirm compliance
     4. **Deploy**: Registry accepts cleaned configurations
   - **Migration Effort**: Low – mechanical removal of 2 fields per affected configuration (~5 minutes per file)
   - **Automated Tool** (future enhancement):
     ```bash
     # Hypothetical migration script
     python scripts/migrate_adr002b.py --scan config/
     # Output: Found 3 files with security policy overrides (auto-fix available)

     python scripts/migrate_adr002b.py --fix config/
     # Removes security_level and allow_downgrade from YAML files
     ```

3. **Plugin Author Responsibility Increased** ⚠️
   - **Challenge**: Plugin authors must choose correct `security_level` at implementation time (cannot defer to deployment)
   - **Risk**: Incorrect choice requires new plugin version + re-certification (higher cost to fix)
   - **Mitigation Strategy**:
     - Provide decision tree in plugin development guide (`docs/development/plugin-authoring.md`)
     - Mandatory architecture review for all new plugins (security level declaration checkpoint)
     - Clear certification checklist for each security level (what filtering logic is required?)
     - Pre-certification consultation available (discuss security level with architecture team before implementation)
   - **Benefit**: Forces security decision at design time (better than runtime misconfiguration risk)

**Security Model Scope**:

4. **Does Not Prevent Malicious Plugin Authors (Out of Scope)** ⚠️
   - **Limitation**: Malicious plugin can still lie about `security_level` in code (e.g., declare SECRET but implement UNOFFICIAL filtering)
   - **ADR-002-B Scope**: Prevents **operators** from overriding policy, not **authors** from lying about capabilities
   - **Existing Defence**: Code review + certification process verifies author honesty (unchanged by this ADR)
   - **Risk Ownership**: Certification process responsibility (not runtime enforcement)
   - **Mitigation**: Same as pre-ADR-002-B – rigorous code review, certification testing, attestation documentation

5. **Registry Declaration Requirement** ⚠️
   - **Limitation**: Layer 2 enforcement requires plugins to be registered with `declared_security_level` parameter
   - **Impact**: Plugins registered without declaration bypass Layer 2 validation (reliant on Layers 1 and 3)
   - **Mitigation Strategy**:
     - Registry registration API enforces declaration (future enhancement: make `declared_security_level` required parameter)
     - CI validation checks all registered plugins have declarations
     - Comprehensive test suite (`test_all_registered_plugins_have_compliant_schemas`) validates registry completeness
   - **Current State**: ~95% of plugins have declarations (validated in test suite)

## Migration Guide

### For Plugin Authors

**Before ADR-002-B** (Security Policy Configurable – Insecure):

```python
# ❌ INSECURE PATTERN (Pre-ADR-002-B)

class MyDataSource(BasePlugin):
    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        path: str,
        security_level: SecurityLevel,  # ❌ Configurable via YAML (insecure)
        allow_downgrade: bool,          # ❌ Configurable via YAML (insecure)
    ):
        super().__init__(security_level=security_level, allow_downgrade=allow_downgrade)
        self.path = path

# Schema exposes security policy (rejected by Layer 1)
MY_DATASOURCE_SCHEMA = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "path": {"type": "string"},
        "security_level": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["UNOFFICIAL", "OFFICIAL", "SECRET"]  # ❌ FORBIDDEN (ADR-002-B)
        },
        "allow_downgrade": {"type": "boolean"}  # ❌ FORBIDDEN (ADR-002-B)
    }
}
```

**After ADR-002-B** (Security Policy Immutable – Secure):

```python
# ✅ SECURE PATTERN (ADR-002-B Compliant)

class MyDataSource(BasePlugin):
    """My datasource with certified SECRET clearance.

    SECURITY POLICY (ADR-002-B - Immutable, Code-Declared):
        security_level: SECRET (certified to handle classified data)
        allow_downgrade: True (certified for trusted downgrade with filtering)
        Certification Date: 2025-10-15
        Certification Scope: Verified filtering at UNOFFICIAL, OFFICIAL, SECRET levels
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        path: str,
        # ✅ NO security_level parameter (not configurable)
        # ✅ NO allow_downgrade parameter (not configurable)
    ):
        """Initialize datasource with IMMUTABLE security policy.

        Args:

            security_level=SecurityLevel.SECRET,  # ← Code-declared (not configurable)
            allow_downgrade=True,                  # ← Code-declared (not configurable)

        self.path = path

# Schema does NOT expose security policy (Layer 1 compliant)

    "additionalProperties": false  # ✅ Strict validation (Layer 1 enforcement)
}
```

**Migration Checklist for Plugin Authors**:
- [ ] Remove `security_level` and `allow_downgrade` from `__init__()` parameters
- [ ] Hard-code `super().__init__(security_level=..., allow_downgrade=...)` with certified values
- [ ] Remove security policy fields from plugin schema `properties`
- [ ] Add `additionalProperties: false` to schema (Layer 1 enforcement)
- [ ] Add docstring documenting code-declared security policy and certification details
- [ ] Update factory `create()` method to strip forbidden fields (Layer 3)
- [ ] Update certification tests to verify immutable policy
- [ ] Submit for re-certification review if security policy changed

### For Operators

**Before ADR-002-B**:

```yaml
# config/experiments/my_experiment.yaml
datasource:
  type: "my_datasource"
  path: "data.csv"
  security_level: "UNOFFICIAL"  # ❌ Will fail after ADR-002-B (rejected by Layer 1)
  allow_downgrade: true         # ❌ Will fail after ADR-002-B (rejected by Layer 1)

sinks:
  - type: "csv_sink"
    path: "output.csv"
    security_level: "OFFICIAL"  # ❌ Will fail after ADR-002-B (rejected by Layer 1)
```

**After ADR-002-B**:

```yaml
# config/experiments/my_experiment.yaml
datasource:
  type: "my_datasource"
  path: "data.csv"
  # ✅ NO security_level (plugin declares it in code)
  # ✅ NO allow_downgrade (plugin declares it in code)

sinks:
  - type: "csv_sink"
    path: "output.csv"
    # ✅ NO security_level (plugin declares it in code)
```

**Migration Steps for Operators**:

1. **Identify Affected Configurations**:
   ```bash
   # Find all configurations with security policy overrides
   grep -r "security_level:" config/experiments/
   grep -r "allow_downgrade:" config/experiments/
   ```

2. **Remove Forbidden Fields**:
   ```bash
   # Manual editing: Remove security_level and allow_downgrade from YAML files
   # Or use automated script (future enhancement):
   # python scripts/migrate_adr002b.py --fix config/
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration Compliance**:
   ```bash
   # Validate all configurations against updated schemas
   python -m elspeth.cli validate-schemas \
     --settings config/suite_defaults.yaml \
     --profile default
   ```

4. **Test Pipeline Execution**:
   ```bash
   # Run sample suite to verify security policy enforcement
   make sample-suite
   ```

**Migration Effort**: ~15 minutes per configuration file (mechanical removal of 2 fields)

### For Security Certifiers

**Updated Certification Checklist**:

**Pre-Certification Review** (Plugin Code):
- [ ] Verify `security_level` is hard-coded in `__init__()` (not parameter)
- [ ] Verify `allow_downgrade` is hard-coded in `__init__()` (not parameter)
- [ ] Confirm schema does not expose `security_level` or `allow_downgrade`
- [ ] Validate factory strips forbidden fields from configuration (Layer 3)
- [ ] Review filtering logic for trusted downgrade plugins (if `allow_downgrade=True`)
- [ ] Confirm no `**kwargs` backdoor allowing silent consumption of forbidden fields

**Certification Testing** (ADR-002-B Compliance):
- [ ] Attempt configuration override in test (should raise `ConfigurationError`)
- [ ] Verify declared security level matches plugin's `get_security_level()` return
- [ ] Validate multi-level operation for trusted downgrade plugins
- [ ] Confirm registry post-creation verification catches mismatches (Layer 2)

**Post-Certification** (Manifest Attestation):
- [ ] Verify reproducibility bundle manifest includes `security_policy` section
- [ ] Confirm manifest signature is valid (RSA-PSS or ECDSA)
- [ ] Validate code hash matches deployed plugin implementation
- [ ] Record certification scope, date, and auditor in manifest

**Re-Certification Triggers**:
- Modification to `security_level` or `allow_downgrade` in code
- Change to filtering logic (for trusted downgrade plugins)
- Addition of new supported operating levels
- Schema changes exposing forbidden fields

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Runtime Validation Only (Rejected)

**Approach**: Allow security policy fields in schema but validate/reject overrides at plugin instantiation.

```python
def create(self, config: dict) -> Plugin:
    if "security_level" in config:
        raise ValueError("Cannot override security_level (ADR-002-B)")
    # ... create plugin with code-declared policy ...
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simpler implementation (no schema validation layer)
- ✅ Clear error messages at runtime
- ✅ Less intrusive (no schema modifications required)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Later error detection (plugin instantiation vs configuration load)
- ❌ Requires consistent enforcement in all factories (easy to forget)
- ❌ No protection against accidentally exposing fields in schema
- ❌ Single point of failure (only one enforcement layer, no defence-in-depth)

**Rejection Rationale**: Earlier detection (Layer 1 schema validation) provides better fail-fast behaviour. Defence-in-depth requires multiple independent enforcement layers. Layer 2 already provides runtime validation; this alternative is redundant without Layer 1 benefits.

### Alternative 2: Separate Policy Declaration File (Rejected)

**Approach**: Declare security policy in separate `plugin_security.yaml` file maintained by security team.

```yaml
# plugin_security.yaml (maintained by security certifiers)
plugins:
  azure_blob_secret:
    security_level: "SECRET"
    allow_downgrade: true
    certification_date: "2025-09-15"
    certification_scope: "Verified blob tag filtering"
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Centralises security policy (easy to audit all policies in one place)
- ✅ Separates security team concerns (certifiers) from development concerns (plugin authors)
- ✅ Enables policy updates without code changes (faster re-certification)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Policy separated from implementation (can drift over time)
- ❌ Doesn't prevent configuration overrides (still need Layer 1/2/3 enforcement)
- ❌ Extra file to maintain (synchronisation burden)
- ❌ Unclear ownership (who updates the file? developers or certifiers?)
- ❌ No compile-time enforcement (policy file might be missing or corrupt)

**Rejection Rationale**: Security policy should live with implementation code (single source of truth). Separate file creates synchronisation risk and doesn't solve the core problem (configuration override prevention). ADR-002-B's code-declared policy provides stronger guarantees with simpler architecture.

### Alternative 3: Plugin-Level Security Policy Lock (Rejected)

**Approach**: Add optional `security_policy_locked: true` field to plugin base class, making policy override opt-in rather than default.

```python
class BasePlugin:
    security_policy_locked: ClassVar[bool] = False  # Default: unlocked (configurable)

class SecureAzureDatasource(BasePlugin):
    security_policy_locked: ClassVar[bool] = True  # Opt-in: locked (immutable)
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Backward compatible (existing plugins default to unlocked)
- ✅ Gradual migration path (lock plugins one at a time)
- ✅ Explicit opt-in for high-security plugins

**Cons**:
- ❌ Default is insecure (new plugins configurable unless author remembers to lock)
- ❌ Mixed security posture across plugin registry (some locked, some unlocked)
- ❌ Confusing for operators (which plugins are locked?)
- ❌ Defeats purpose of ADR-005 (frozen plugins can be unfrozen if unlocked)
- ❌ Audit complexity (certifiers must verify lock status for every plugin)

**Rejection Rationale**: Security should be default, not opt-in (ADR-001 security-first principle). Mixed security posture creates confusion and audit burden. ADR-002-B's universal immutability provides consistent security model across all plugins with clearer semantics.
