# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting significant architectural and design decisions for Elspeth.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They provide a historical record of why certain design choices were made, helping current and future team members understand the reasoning behind the system's architecture.

## Active ADRs

These decisions are currently in effect and guide ongoing development:

## Security Policy Architecture: ADR Dependency Graph

The security policy (ADRs 001-006) forms a layered defense architecture. Each ADR builds on or extends previous decisions:

```
ADR-001 (Design Philosophy)
    ‚Üì
ADR-002 (MLS Core) ‚Üê foundational security model
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí ADR-002-A (Container Model) ‚Üê extends 002 with classification tracking
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí ADR-006 (Exception Policy) ‚Üê refines 002-A exception handling
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí ADR-002-B (Immutable Metadata) ‚Üê extends 002 with policy immutability
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí ADR-005 (Frozen Plugins) ‚Üê implements 002-B with allow_downgrade
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí ADR-003 (Plugin Registry) ‚Üê supports 002 validation
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí ADR-004 (BasePlugin ABC) ‚Üê required by 003 for nominal typing
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí ADR-005 (Frozen Plugins) ‚Üê extends 004 with allow_downgrade parameter
```

**Reading Order**: For newcomers to the security architecture, we recommend this sequence:

1. [ADR-001](001-design-philosophy.md) ‚Äì Understand security-first principles
2. [ADR-002](002-security-architecture.md) ‚Äì Core MLS model and fail-fast validation
3. [ADR-002-A](002-a-trusted-container-model.md) ‚Äì Classification container and high water mark
4. [ADR-004](004-mandatory-baseplugin-inheritance.md) ‚Äì Plugin inheritance and "security bones"
5. [ADR-005](005-frozen-plugin-capability.md) ‚Äì Frozen plugins and allow_downgrade semantics
6. [ADR-002-B](002-b-security-policy-metadata.md) ‚Äì Immutable policy enforcement
7. [ADR-003](003-plugin-type-registry.md) ‚Äì Plugin registry completeness
8. [ADR-006](006-security-critical-exception-policy.md) ‚Äì Fail-loud exception policy

**Key Relationships**:
- **ADR-005** is referenced by both ADR-002 and ADR-004 (implements policy from 002-B, extends architecture from 004)
- **ADR-006** refines exception handling established in ADR-002-A (classification container violations)
- **ADR-004** is required by ADR-003 (nominal typing prevents registry bypass)

## Historical ADRs

These decisions have been completed or superseded but remain documented for historical context:

| ADR | Title | Status | Summary |
|-----|-------|--------|---------|
| [A001](historical/A001-remove-legacy-code.md) | Remove Legacy Code | Completed | Removed duplicate orchestration helpers after new pipeline achieved feature parity |
| [A002](historical/A002-complete-registry-migration.md) | Complete Registry Migration | Completed | Migrated all plugin registries to unified `BasePluginRegistry` framework |

**Note**: Historical ADRs use 'A' prefix (A001, A002) to avoid numbering conflicts with active ADRs.

## ADR Format

We follow the lightweight [Michael Nygard ADR format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) with structured sections for clarity. See **[000-template.md](000-template.md)** for the complete template with detailed guidance.

**Core structure:**

- **Status**: Current state (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded) with date
- **Context**: Problem statement and background
- **Decision**: What we decided, with specific numbered points and code examples
- **Consequences**: Benefits, Limitations/Trade-offs, and Implementation Impact
- **Related Documents**: Links to related ADRs, architecture docs, and implementation files

## Creating a New ADR

1. **Determine the next number**: Check the highest numbered ADR in this directory
2. **Copy the template**: `cp 000-template.md XXX-short-title.md`
3. **Fill in the sections**:
   - **Context**: Why is this decision needed? What's the problem? What alternatives were considered?
   - **Decision**: What are we going to do? Be specific with numbered points and code examples.
   - **Consequences**: Break down into Benefits, Limitations/Trade-offs (with mitigations), and Implementation Impact
   - **Related Documents**: Link to related ADRs and implementation files
4. **Start with Status: Proposed** for review
5. **Create a PR** and discuss with the team
6. **Update to Status: Accepted** once approved and merged
7. **Add metadata**: Include Last Updated date and Author(s) at the bottom

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Draft under review
- **Accepted**: Approved and in effect
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended but not replaced
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR (link to the new one)

When an ADR is superseded or becomes historical, move it to the `historical/` subdirectory and update this README.

## Principles for Good ADRs

- **Capture context**: Future readers won't have the same context you do today
- **Be specific**: Vague decisions lead to inconsistent implementations
- **Document trade-offs**: Honest assessment of limitations helps future decision-makers
- **Link to related docs**: Create a documentation graph for easy navigation
- **Keep it concise**: Aim for 1-2 pages; link to detailed specs if needed
- **Use code examples**: Show, don't just tell (especially for technical decisions)
