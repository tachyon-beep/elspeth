# Documentation Audit and Update Summary
Date: 2025-10-12

## Files Updated
- docs/architecture/architecture-overview.md – Added footnoted cross-references, concurrency/early-stop annotations, analytics sinks, and artifact chaining updates.
- docs/architecture/component-diagram.md – Refreshed diagrams for middleware chains and artifact pipelines, introduced section anchors for registry/config references.
- docs/architecture/data-flow-diagrams.md – Documented trust boundaries, retry/telemetry flows, and suite lifecycle checkpoints.
- docs/architecture/security-controls.md – Expanded control descriptions (middleware safeguards, artifact clearance, managed identity) with cross-doc footnotes.
- docs/architecture/threat-surfaces.md – Updated trust zones, external interfaces, and analytics/reporting risk annotations.
- docs/architecture/configuration-security.md – Added loader/secret governance notes and suite default guidance.
- docs/architecture/plugin-security-model.md – Documented registry enforcement, early-stop lifecycle, and artifact token governance.
- docs/architecture/audit-logging.md – Added retry exhaustion, middleware telemetry, and visual evidence logging notes.
- docs/architecture/dependency-analysis.md – Highlighted optional extras, tooling dependencies, and transitive risk considerations.
- docs/architecture/CONTROL_INVENTORY.md – Realigned control references and added Azure telemetry control entry.
- Operational docs (migration-guide.md, logging-standards.md, release-checklist.md, reporting-and-suite-management.md, examples_colour_animals.md, README.md) – Synced with new concurrency, analytics, visual sink, and dependency guidance.

## New Content Added
- Footnoted cross-reference network across architecture docs (security, auditing, data flow, component diagrams).
- Middleware and telemetry updates covering Azure Environment suite hooks, retry exhaustion payloads, and analytics sinks.
- Dependency extras guidance including analytics-visual optional install path.
- Verification checklist for suite report generation and release readiness (dependency audit, signed artefacts, visual analytics).

## Gaps Identified
- No dedicated how-to for configuring rate limiter thresholds per deployment; consider authoring a tuning guide.
- Sample suite README lacks explicit instructions for analytics-visual sink enablement; add screenshots or CLI outputs in future iteration.
- Need formal SOP for rotating signed artifact keys post-release (documented only in checklist bullet).

## Verification Status
- Claims cross-checked against source modules (`src/elspeth/core/experiments/runner.py`, `src/elspeth/plugins/outputs/analytics_report.py`, `src/elspeth/plugins/llms/middleware_azure.py`, etc.).
- Tested commands: `make sample-suite`, `python -m elspeth.cli --reports-dir ...` executed locally prior to update (artifact availability confirmed).
- Pending manual review: ensure `python -m elspeth.tools.verify_signature` helper works with refreshed bundle examples.

## Cross-Reference Map
| Component | Documentation Reference |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Concurrency & Checkpoints | docs/architecture/data-flow-diagrams.md (Update 2025-10-12: Parallel Execution Gate), docs/migration-guide.md (Added 2025-10-12 checklist) |
| Azure Telemetry | docs/architecture/audit-logging.md (Update 2025-10-12: Azure Telemetry), docs/architecture/security-controls.md (Update 2025-10-12: Middleware Safeguards) |
| Analytics Sinks | docs/architecture/architecture-overview.md (Update 2025-10-12: Early Stop and Baseline Analytics), docs/reporting-and-suite-management.md (Section 2) |
| Artifact Clearance | docs/architecture/security-controls.md (Update 2025-10-12: Artifact Clearance), docs/architecture/component-diagram.md (Update 2025-10-12: Artifact Pipeline) |
| Dependency Extras | docs/architecture/dependency-analysis.md (Optional Extras), README.md (Optional extras list) |

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Author a rate limiting/concurrency tuning guide referencing recent telemetry fields.
2. Capture screenshots or sample artefact snippets for analytics_visual outputs to include in reporting documentation.
3. Validate signed artifact verification helper against current bundle format and record the procedure in docs/security-controls.md or release-checklist.md.
