- `docs/architecture/component-diagram.md` – Inserted new diagrams for prompt/validation flows and updated registry/citation references.
- `docs/architecture/data-flow-diagrams.md` – Documented datasource path migration, retry metadata propagation, and artifact rehydration notes.
- `docs/architecture/security-controls.md` – Refreshed module locations, listed middleware controls, and expanded retry/early-stop coverage.
- `docs/architecture/threat-surfaces.md` – Realigned external interface paths and catalogued Azure ML/reporting threat edges.
- `docs/architecture/audit-logging.md` – Updated middleware/runner citations, added early-stop telemetry guidance, and suite reporting audit steps.
- `docs/architecture/configuration-security.md` – New document covering validation pipeline, secret handling, concurrency/retry configuration, and suite exports.
- `docs/architecture/plugin-security-model.md` – Updated registry references, sink path migrations, and suite reporting integration notes.
- `docs/architecture/CONTROL_INVENTORY.md` – New control inventory table linking controls to implementation/tests/docs.
- `docs/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` – New matrix mapping core components to documentation anchors.
- `docs/development/dependency-analysis.md` – Refreshed dependency locations and extras guidance.
- `docs/development/logging-standards.md` – Added analytics/visual sink logging expectations and path realignment.
- `docs/migration-guide.md` – Added retry/cost telemetry mapping, visual sink path update, and suite reporting citation refresh.
- `docs/release-checklist.md` – Added analytics sink path, updated CLI references, and dry-run guidance.
- `docs/reporting-and-suite-management.md` – Updated CLI option references, logging/archival notes, and dry-run guidance.
- `docs/examples/colour-animals.md` – Added retry preview/update notes and limiter references.
- `README.md` – Documented resilient execution highlight, updated documentation hub entries, and noted datasource namespace change.
- `AGENTS.md` – Clarified plugin namespace migration for contributors.

## New Content Added
- Created `docs/architecture/configuration-security.md` to capture validation, secrets, concurrency/retry, and suite governance controls.
- Added security control inventory and traceability matrix deliverables for accreditation traceability.
- Introduced prompt/validation and suite reporting diagrams illustrating new subsystems and telemetry flows.
- Documented early-stop telemetry, suite reporting audit practices, and analytics sink logging standards.

## Gaps Identified
- Confirm whether additional organisational notes exist outside the repository; no `notes/` directory was present to cross-check against architecture updates.
- Suite export/test fixtures should be reviewed periodically to ensure scaffolded templates remain in sync with CLI behaviour.
- Consider adding automated docs validation (e.g., `pytest --doctest-glob`) to detect future path migrations.

## Verification Status
- Cross-checked concurrency, retry, middleware, sink, and reporting references against current source modules (`src/elspeth/core/experiments/runner.py`, `src/elspeth/plugins/nodes/**`, `src/elspeth/tools/reporting.py`).
- Verified CLI option locations (`src/elspeth/cli.py:80-105`, `395-458`) and suite management logic during documentation updates.
- Confirmed dependency listings against `pyproject.toml` and corresponding plugin implementations.

## Cross-Reference Map
- Concurrency/Retry metadata ↔ docs/architecture/architecture-overview.md (Concurrency section) ↔ docs/architecture/audit-logging.md (Retry Exhaustion Events).
- Middleware safeguards ↔ docs/architecture/security-controls.md ↔ docs/development/logging-standards.md.
- Suite reporting pipeline ↔ docs/reporting-and-suite-management.md ↔ docs/architecture/component-diagram.md (Suite reporting outputs).
- Secret management ↔ docs/architecture/configuration-security.md ↔ docs/architecture/threat-surfaces.md (Storage Interfaces).
- Control inventory ↔ docs/architecture/CONTROL_INVENTORY.md ↔ docs/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md for audit traceability.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Review integration tests covering suite exports (`tests/test_suite_reporter.py`, `tests/test_reporting.py`) to ensure new documentation notes align with automated coverage.
2. Publish an updated `LICENSE` and verify README guidance once legal guidance is finalised.
3. Evaluate automated link checking for documentation to catch future path migrations.
