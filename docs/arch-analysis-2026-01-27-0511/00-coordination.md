# Architecture Analysis Coordination

## Analysis Configuration
- **Scope**: Full `/home/john/elspeth-rapid` codebase
- **Deliverables**: Option C (Architect-Ready) - Full analysis + code quality + architect handover
- **Strategy**: PARALLEL with 4 coordinated subagents
- **Time constraint**: None specified
- **Complexity estimate**: HIGH (45K LOC, 11 subsystems, sophisticated type system)

## Deliverable Checklist
- [x] 01-discovery-findings.md - Holistic assessment
- [x] 02-subsystem-catalog.md - Detailed subsystem entries (17 subsystems)
- [x] 03-diagrams.md - C4 architecture diagrams (9 Mermaid diagrams)
- [x] 04-final-report.md - Synthesized report
- [x] 05-quality-assessment.md - Code quality assessment (Grade: A-)
- [x] 06-architect-handover.md - Architect improvement planning

## Execution Log
- [2026-01-27 05:11] Created workspace at docs/arch-analysis-2026-01-27-0511/
- [2026-01-27 05:11] User selected Option C (Architect-Ready)
- [2026-01-27 05:11] Beginning holistic assessment...
- [2026-01-27 05:13] Completed discovery findings (01-discovery-findings.md)
- [2026-01-27 05:13] Identified 11 major subsystems
- [2026-01-27 05:13] Selected PARALLEL strategy with 4 subagents
- [2026-01-27 05:13] Spawning parallel exploration agents...

## Subagent Allocation
| Agent | Subsystems | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Landscape, Checkpoint, Retention | Audit critical path |
| 2 | Engine, DAG, Tokens | Execution core |
| 3 | Plugin Framework, LLM, Azure | Plugin ecosystem |
| 4 | Contracts, Config, TUI | Supporting infrastructure |
