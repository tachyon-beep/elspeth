# Codex Scratch Log

This is an internal scratchpad for ongoing engineering notes. Update freely while keeping entries terse.

## 2025-10-20

- Split `core/validation/validators.py` into `settings.py`, `suite.py`, `rules.py`, `schemas.py`; updated documentation and tests.
- Test suite (`pytest -m "not slow" --no-cov`) passes via `.venv`.
- Remaining large modules to tackle next:
  1. `core/base/schema.py` – break into model factory/inference/helpers.
  2. `core/utils/logging.py` – isolate serialization/file handling.
  3. `core/experiments/plugin_registry.py` – extract validation helpers.

> Next session: start with `core/base/schema.py` decomposition; ensure schema inference tests are covered.
- Ran lint pass (`ruff check --fix`), committed `Sort imports via ruff`.
- Verified `mypy --config-file pyproject.toml src` clean; refined ignores in logging/config_merger/security.
- Confirmed lint configs (ruff & mypy) enforced, no unreasonable disables.

## 2025-10-21

- Converted `core/base/schema.py` into a package with `base.py`, `inference.py`, `model_factory.py`, and `validation.py`; `__init__` re-exports maintain public imports.
- Deferred pytest run until virtualenv bootstrap; next pass should cover schema inference/compat tests once `.venv` is ready.
