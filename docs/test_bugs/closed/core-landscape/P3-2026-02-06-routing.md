# Test Bug Report: Remove redundant test file routing

## Status: RESOLVED

**Resolved:** 2026-02-06
**Action:** Deleted redundant file

## Summary

- This is a thin test file that verifies the re-export of `RoutingSpec` from the `elspeth.core.landscape` package. The tests are minimal and the file explicitly states that canonical tests are elsewhere (`tests/contracts/test_routing.py`). The tests validate basic construction and immutability but provide little additional coverage.

## Severity

- Severity: minor
- Priority: P3
- Verdict: **DELETE**

## Reporter

- Name or handle: Test Audit
- Date: 2026-02-06
- Audit file: docs/test_audit/tests_core_landscape_test_routing.py.audit.md

## Test File

- **File:** `tests/core/landscape/test_routing.py`
- **Lines:** 39
- **Test count:** 4

## Findings

- See audit file for details


## Verdict Detail

**DELETE or MERGE** - This file adds minimal value. If the re-export path needs testing, a single test verifying the import works would suffice. The behavior tests should live in the canonical location. Consider deleting this file and adding a single re-export verification test to the canonical file, or consolidating into a general "public API exports" test file.

## Proposed Fix

- [x] Redundant tests removed
- [x] Essential coverage preserved in canonical location
- [x] No test duplication remains

## Resolution

**Action taken:** Deleted `tests/core/landscape/test_routing.py`

**Verification:**
- All 4 tests in the deleted file were exact duplicates of tests in `tests/contracts/test_routing.py`
- Canonical tests (`TestRoutingSpec` class) cover: MOVE mode, COPY mode, immutability
- The "import test" was tautological - the import at module level already proves the re-export works
- After deletion: 25 tests pass in `tests/contracts/test_routing.py`

## Tests

- Canonical tests verified: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/contracts/test_routing.py -v` (25 passed)

## Notes

- Source audit: `docs/test_audit/tests_core_landscape_test_routing.py.audit.md`
