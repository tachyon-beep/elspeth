# Test Bug Report: Fix weak assertions in enums

## Summary

- This file tests enum contracts used throughout the system (Determinism, RowOutcome, RoutingMode, RunStatus, TriggerType). Tests verify enum values match architecture specifications and can be serialized/deserialized for database storage. Coverage is good but there is some redundancy.

## Severity

- Severity: trivial
- Priority: P2
- Verdict: **KEEP**

## Reporter

- Name or handle: Test Audit

## Test File

- **File:** `tests/contracts/test_enums.py`
- **Lines:** 167
- **Test count:** 18

## Findings

- **Lines 85-95:**: Tests `test_row_outcome_expanded_exists` and `test_row_outcome_buffered_exists` are redundant with `test_has_all_terminal_states` (lines 49-64) which already verifies all RowOutcome values exist with correct string representations.
- **Lines 141-145 (test_trigger_type_exists):**: This test only asserts `TriggerType is not None`. If the import succeeded, this will always pass. This is a tautological test - it provides no value.
- **Lines 157-166 (test_trigger_type_is_str_enum):**: Duplicates verification already done in `test_trigger_type_values` (lines 147-155) since both tests verify the enum values. The string comparison and reconstruction tests (lines 162-166) are valuable but the setup overlaps.
- **Lines 45-47:**: Type ignore comments (`# type: ignore[comparison-overlap]` and `# type: ignore[unreachable]`) are necessary because the test is verifying runtime behavior that conflicts with static type analysis. This is correct.
- **Lines 97-98:**: Comment explains why individual `is_terminal` tests were removed in favor of the comprehensive test. Good documentation.
- **Line 100-106 (test_all_outcomes_have_is_terminal):**: This test verifies the `is_terminal` property exists on all enum values by accessing it. While it doesn't assert values, it would fail if any outcome lacked the property.


## Verdict Detail

**KEEP** - Tests provide good coverage of enum contracts. The redundancy issues are minor and the tests correctly verify important enum behavior for database serialization and architectural compliance.

## Proposed Fix

- [ ] Weak assertions strengthened
- [ ] Redundant tests consolidated
- [ ] Test intent clearly expressed in assertions

## Tests

- Run after fix: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/contracts/test_enums.py -v`
