## Implementation Phases (TDD Approach)

### Phase [N.0]: [Phase Name] ([X-Y] hours)

#### Objective
[What this phase accomplishes]

#### Implementation

**Files to Modify**:
```python
# [path/to/file.py]
# Show key code changes
```

**Changes**:
1. [Change 1]
2. [Change 2]
3. [Change 3]

#### TDD Cycle

**RED - Write Failing Test**:
```python
# tests/test_[name].py (NEW FILE)
import pytest

def test_[requirement]():
    """[SECURITY|FUNCTIONAL]: [What this test validates]."""
    # Arrange
    [setup code]

    # Act
    [action that should fail]

    # Assert
    with pytest.raises([ErrorType], match="[expected message]"):
        [code that triggers error]
```

**GREEN - Implement Fix**:
```python
# src/[path]/[file].py
# Show implementation that makes test pass
```

**REFACTOR - Improve Code**:
[Describe refactoring steps: extract methods, improve names, add docs, etc.]

#### Migration (if breaking changes)

**Step 1**: [Migration step]
```bash
# Commands to discover affected code
```

**Step 2**: [Migration step]
```[language]
# BEFORE (INVALID after changes)
[old pattern]

# AFTER (VALID)
[new pattern]
```

#### Exit Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] Tests passing: [current]/[current] ([delta] new tests)
- [ ] MyPy clean
- [ ] Ruff clean

#### Commit Plan

**Commit [N]**: [Commit title]
```
[Conventional commit format message]

- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]
- Tests: [old count] â†’ [new count] passing (+[delta] tests)

Files modified:
- [path/to/file.py]
- [path/to/file.py]

[ADR reference, closes issue reference]
```

### Phase [N.1]: [Next Phase]

[Repeat structure above]

---

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests ([X-Y] tests)

**Coverage Areas**:
- [ ] [Test area 1] ([N] tests)
- [ ] [Test area 2] ([N] tests)
- [ ] [Test area 3] ([N] tests)

**Example Test Cases**:
```python
def test_[scenario]():
    """[What this validates]."""
    # Test implementation
```

### Integration Tests ([X-Y] tests)

**Scenarios**:
- [ ] [Scenario 1]
- [ ] [Scenario 2]
- [ ] [Scenario 3]

### Security Tests (for vulnerabilities, [X-Y] tests)

**Attack Scenarios**:
- [ ] [Attack 1] - [Defense validated]
- [ ] [Attack 2] - [Defense validated]

### Property-Based Tests (if applicable)

**Invariants**:
1. [Invariant 1]
2. [Invariant 2]

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given([strategy])
def test_[property]([parameters]):
    """[Property that must hold]."""
    # Property test implementation
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

**Risk 1: [Risk Name]**
- **Impact**: [What happens if this risk materializes]
- **Likelihood**: [High|Medium|Low]
- **Mitigation**: [How to prevent or handle]
- **Rollback**: [How to recover]

**Risk 2: [Risk Name]**
[Similar structure]

### Medium Risks

- **Likelihood**: [High|Medium|Low]
- **Mitigation**: [Prevention/handling]
- **Rollback**: [Recovery approach]

- **Impact**: [Minimal impact description]
- **Mitigation**: [Simple prevention]
- **Rollback**: [Quick recovery]

---

## Rollback Plan

### If [Phase/Feature] Causes Issues

**Clean Revert Approach (Pre-1.0)**:
```bash
# Revert Phase [N]
git revert HEAD

# Revert Phase [N-1]
git revert HEAD~1

# Full rollback (all phases)
git revert HEAD~[N]..HEAD

# Verify tests pass
pytest
```

**Feature Flag Approach (Post-1.0)**:
```python
# If feature flags used:
if FEATURE_FLAGS.enable_[feature]:
    [new code path]
else:
    [old code path - fallback]
```

### If [Specific Issue] Occurs

**Symptom**: [What users/developers will see]

```bash
# Commands to verify the issue
```

**Fix**: [How to resolve without rollback]
